	<h1>THE<br />
	<span class="fancy">CREATURE</span><br />
	FROM<br />
	CLEVELAND DEPTHS</h1>

	<p class="author">By FRITZ LEIBER</p>

	<p class="illustrator">Illustrated by WOOD</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">&#8220;Come</span> on, Gussy,&#8221; Fay prodded
	quietly, &#8220;quit stalking
	around like a neurotic bear and
	suggest something for my invention
	team to work on. I enjoy
	visiting you and Daisy, but I
	can&#8217;t stay aboveground all night.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;If being outside the shelters
	makes you nervous, don&#8217;t come
	around any more,&#8221; Gusterson
	told him, continuing to stalk.
	&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t your invention
	team think of something to invent?
	Why don&#8217;t you? Hah!&#8221; In
	the &#8220;Hah!&#8221; lay triumphant condemnation
	of a whole way of life.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We do,&#8221; Fay responded imperturbably,
	&#8220;but a fresh viewpoint sometimes helps.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say it does! Fay, you burglar,
	I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ve got twenty
	people like myself you milk for
	free ideas. First you irritate their
	bark and then you make the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"></a>rounds every so often to draw off
	the latex or the maple gloop.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay smiled. &#8220;It ought to please
	you that society still has a use
	for you outre inner-directed
	types. It takes something to make
	a junior executive stay aboveground
	after dark, when the missiles
	are on the prowl.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Society can&#8217;t have much use
	for <ins title="use">us</ins> or it&#8217;d pay us something,&#8221;
	Gusterson sourly asserted, staring
	blankly at the tankless TV
	and kicking it lightly as he
	passed on.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re wrong about that,
	Gussy. Money&#8217;s not the key goad
	with you inner-directeds. I got
	that straight from our Motivations
	chief.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Did he tell you what we
	should use instead to pay the grocer?
	A deep inner sense of
	achievement, maybe? Fay, why
	should I do any free thinking for
	Micro Systems?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why, Gussy. Simply
	because you get a kick out of
	insulting us with sardonic ideas.
	If we take one of them seriously,
	you think we&#8217;re degrading ourselves,
	and that pleases you even
	more. Like making someone
	laugh at a lousy pun.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Gusterson</span> held still in his
	roaming and grinned. &#8220;That
	the reason, huh? I suppose my
	suggestions would have to be
	something in the line of ultra-subminiaturized
	computers,
	where one sinister fine-etched
	molecule does the work of three
	big bumbling brain cells?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not necessarily. Micro Systems
	is branching out. Wheel as
	free as a rogue star. But I&#8217;ll pass
	along to Promotion your one
	molecule-three brain cell sparkler.
	It&#8217;s a slight exaggeration,
	but it&#8217;s catchy.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have my kids watch your
	ads to see if you use it and then
	I&#8217;ll sue the whole underworld.&#8221;
	Gusterson frowned as he resumed
	his stalking. He stared puzzledly
	at the antique TV. &#8220;How about
	inventing a plutonium termite?&#8221;
	he said suddenly. &#8220;It would get
	rid of those stockpiles that are
	worrying you moles to death.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay grimaced noncommittally
	and cocked his head.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, then, how about a
	beauty mask? How about that,
	hey? I don&#8217;t mean one to repair
	a woman&#8217;s complexion, but one
	she&#8217;d wear all the time that&#8217;d
	make her look like a 17-year-old
	sexpot. That&#8217;d end <em>her</em> worries.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s for me,&#8221; Daisy
	called from the kitchen. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
	make Gusterson suffer. I&#8217;ll make
	him crawl around on his hands
	and knees begging my immature
	favors.&#8221;</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"></a>
		<img src="images/illo-1.jpg" width="400" height="548" alt="A montage: A fellow holding a gun on a man; a man and a woman nearly kissing; a one-eyed robot tearing up paper." />
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; Gusterson
	called back. &#8220;You having a face
	like that would scare the kids.
	Better cancel that one, Fay. Half
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"></a>the adult race looking like Vina
	Vidarsson is too awful a
	thought.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yah, you&#8217;re just scared of
	making a million dollars,&#8221; Daisy
	jeered.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I sure am,&#8221; Gusterson said
	solemnly, scanning the fuzzy
	floor from one murky glass wall
	to the other, hesitating at the TV.
	&#8220;How about something homey
	now, like a flock of little prickly
	cylinders that roll around the
	floor collecting lint and flub?
	They&#8217;d work by electricity, or at
	a pinch cats could bat &#8217;em
	around. Every so often they&#8217;d be
	automatically herded together
	and the lint cleaned off the
	bristles.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No good,&#8221; Fay said. &#8220;There&#8217;s
	no lint underground and cats are
	<em>verboten</em>. And the aboveground
	market doesn&#8217;t amount to more
	moneywise than the state of
	Southern Illinois. Keep it
	grander, Gussy, and more impractical&#8212;you
	can&#8217;t sell people
	merely useful ideas.&#8221; From his
	hassock in the center of the room
	he looked uneasily around. &#8220;Say,
	did that violet tone in the glass
	come from the high Cleveland
	hydrogen bomb or is it just age
	and ultraviolet, like desert glass?&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">&#8220;No</span>, somebody&#8217;s grandfather
	liked it that color,&#8221; Gusterson
	informed him with happy
	bitterness. &#8220;I like it too&#8212;the
	glass, I mean, not the tint. People
	who live in glass houses can see
	the stars&#8212;especially when
	there&#8217;s a window-washing streak
	in their germ-plasm.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Gussy, why don&#8217;t you move
	underground?&#8221; Fay asked, his
	voice taking on a missionary
	note. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot easier living in
	one room, believe me. You don&#8217;t
	have to tramp from room to room
	hunting things.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I like the exercise,&#8221; Gusterson
	said stoutly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But I bet Daisy&#8217;d prefer it
	underground. And your kids
	wouldn&#8217;t have to explain why
	their father lives like a Red Indian.
	Not to mention the safety
	factor and insurance savings and
	a crypt church within easy slidewalk
	distance. Incidentally, we
	see the stars all the time, better
	than you do&#8212;by repeater.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Stars by repeater,&#8221; Gusterson
	murmured to the ceiling, pausing
	for God to comment. Then, &#8220;No,
	Fay, even if I could afford it&#8212;and
	stand it&#8212;I&#8217;m such a
	bad-luck Harry that just when
	I got us all safely stowed at
	the N minus 1 sublevel, the
	Soviets would discover an
	earthquake bomb that struck
	from below, and I&#8217;d have to follow
	everybody back to the treetops.
	<em>Hey! How about bubble
	homes in orbit around earth?</em>
	Micro Systems could subdivide
	the world&#8217;s most spacious suburb
	<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"></a>and all you moles could go ellipsing.
	Space is as safe as there is:
	no air, no shock waves. Free fall&#8217;s
	the ultimate in restfulness&#8212;great
	health benefits. Commute
	by rocket&#8212;or better yet stay
	home and do all your business by
	TV-telephone, or by waldo if it
	were that sort of thing. Even pet
	your girl by remote control&#8212;she
	in her bubble, you in yours,
	whizzing through vacuum. Oh,
	damn-damn-<em>damn</em>-<em>damn</em>-DAMN!&#8221;</p>

	<p>He was glaring at the blank
	screen of the TV, his big hands
	clenching and unclenching.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let Fay give you apoplexy&#8212;he&#8217;s
	not worth it,&#8221; Daisy
	said, sticking her trim head in
	from the kitchen, while Fay inquired
	anxiously, &#8220;Gussy, what&#8217;s
	the matter?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nothing, you worm!&#8221; Gusterson
	roared, &#8220;Except that an hour
	ago I forgot to tune in on the only
	TV program I&#8217;ve wanted to hear
	this year&#8212;<em>Finnegans Wake</em>
	scored for English, Gaelic and
	brogue. Oh, damn-<em>damn</em>-DAMN!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; Fay said lightly. &#8220;I
	didn&#8217;t know they were releasing
	it on flat TV too.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">&#8220;Well</span>, they were! Some
	things are too damn big
	to keep completely underground.
	And I had to forget! I&#8217;m always
	doing it&#8212;I miss everything!
	Look here, you rat,&#8221; he blatted
	suddenly at Fay, shaking his
	finger under the latter&#8217;s chin, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
	tell you what you can have that
	ignorant team of yours invent.
	They can fix me up a mechanical
	secretary that I can feed orders
	into and that&#8217;ll remind me when
	the exact moment comes to listen
	to TV or phone somebody or
	mail in a story or write a letter
	or pick up a magazine or look at
	an eclipse or a new orbiting station
	or fetch the kids from school
	or buy Daisy a bunch of flowers
	or whatever it is. It&#8217;s got to be
	something that&#8217;s always with me,
	not something I have to go and
	consult or that I can get sick of
	and put down somewhere. And
	it&#8217;s got to remind me forcibly
	enough so that I take notice and
	don&#8217;t just shrug it aside, like I
	sometimes do even when Daisy
	reminds me of things. That&#8217;s
	what your stupid team can invent
	for me! If they do a good job, I&#8217;ll
	pay &#8217;em as much as fifty dollars!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t sound like anything
	so very original to me,&#8221; Fay
	commented coolly, leaning back
	from the wagging finger. &#8220;I think
	all senior executives have something
	of that sort. At least, their
	secretary keeps some kind of
	file&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not looking for something
	with spiked falsies and nylons up
	to the neck,&#8221; interjected Gusterson,
	whose ideas about secretaries
	were a trifle lurid. &#8220;I just want a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"></a>mech reminder&#8212;that&#8217;s all!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll keep the idea in
	mind,&#8221; Fay assured him, &#8220;along
	with the bubble homes and
	beauty masks. If we ever develop
	anything along those lines, I&#8217;ll
	let you know. If it&#8217;s a beauty
	mask, I&#8217;ll bring Daisy a pilot
	model&#8212;to use to scare strange
	kids.&#8221; He put his watch to his
	ear. &#8220;Good lord, I&#8217;m going to have
	to cut to make it underground before
	the main doors close. Just
	ten minutes to Second Curfew!
	&#8217;By, Gus. &#8217;By, Daze.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Two minutes later, living room
	lights out, they watched Fay&#8217;s
	foreshortened antlike figure scurrying
	across the balding ill-lit
	park toward the nearest escalator.</p>

	<p>Gusterson said, &#8220;Weird to
	think of that big bright space-poor
	glamor basement stretching
	around everywhere underneath.
	Did you remind Smitty to put a
	new bulb in the elevator?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The Smiths moved out this
	morning,&#8221; Daisy said tonelessly.
	&#8220;They went underneath.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Like cockroaches,&#8221; Gusterson
	said. &#8220;Cockroaches leavin&#8217; a
	sinkin&#8217; apartment building. Next
	the ghosts&#8217;ll be retreatin&#8217; to the
	shelters.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Anyhow, from now on we&#8217;re
	our own janitors,&#8221; Daisy said.</p>

	<p>He nodded. &#8220;Just leaves three
	families besides us loyal to this
	glass death trap. Not countin&#8217;
	ghosts.&#8221; He sighed. Then, &#8220;You
	like to move below, Daisy?&#8221; he
	asked softly, putting his arm
	lightly across her shoulders. &#8220;Get
	a woozy eyeful of the bright lights
	and all for a change? Be a rat for
	a while? Maybe we&#8217;re getting too
	old to be bats. I could scrounge
	me a company job and have a
	thinking closet all to myself and
	two secretaries with stainless
	steel breasts. Life&#8217;d be easier for
	you and a lot cleaner. And you&#8217;d
	sleep safer.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; she answered
	and paused. She ran her fingertip
	slowly across the murky glass, its
	violet tint barely perceptible
	against a cold dim light across
	the park. &#8220;But somehow,&#8221; she
	said, snaking her arm around his
	waist, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d sleep
	happier&#8212;or one bit excited.&#8221;</p>

	<h2>II</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">Three</span> weeks later Fay, dropping
	in again, handed to Daisy
	the larger of the two rather small
	packages he was carrying.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a so-called beauty mask,&#8221;
	he told her, &#8220;complete with wig,
	eyelashes, and wettable velvet
	lips. It even breathes&#8212;pinholed
	elastiskin with a static adherence-charge.
	But Micro Systems had
	nothing to do with it, thank God.
	Beauty Trix put it on the market
	ten days ago and it&#8217;s already
	started a teen-age craze. Some
	<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"></a>boys are wearing them too, and
	the police are yipping at Trix for
	encouraging transvestism with
	psychic repercussions.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I hear somewhere that
	Trix is a secret subsidiary of
	Micro?&#8221; Gusterson demanded,
	rearing up from his ancient electric
	typewriter. &#8220;No, you&#8217;re not
	stopping me writing, Fay&#8212;it&#8217;s
	the gut of evening. If I do any
	more I won&#8217;t have any juice to
	start with tomorrow. I got another
	of my insanity thrillers
	moving. A real id-teaser. In this
	one not only all the characters
	are crazy but the robot psychiatrist
	too.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The vending machines are
	jumping with insanity novels,&#8221;
	Fay commented. &#8220;Odd they&#8217;re so
	popular.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson chortled. &#8220;The only
	way you outer-directed moles
	will accept individuality any
	more even in a fictional character,
	without your superegos getting
	seasick, is for them to be
	crazy. Hey, Daisy! Lemme see
	that beauty mask!&#8221;</p>

	<p>But his wife, backing out of
	the room, hugged the package to
	her bosom and solemnly shook
	her head.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A hell of a thing,&#8221; Gusterson
	complained, &#8220;not even to be able
	to see what my stolen ideas look
	like.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I got a present for you too,&#8221;
	Fay said. &#8220;Something you might
	think of as a royalty on all the
	inventions someone thought of a
	little ahead of you. Fifty dollars
	by your own evaluation.&#8221; He held
	out the smaller package. &#8220;Your
	tickler.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My <em>what?</em>&#8221; Gusterson demanded
	suspiciously.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your tickler. The mech reminder
	you wanted. It turns out
	that the file a secretary keeps to
	remind her boss to do certain
	things at certain times is called
	a tickler file. So we named this
	a tickler. Here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson still didn&#8217;t touch the
	package. &#8220;You mean you actually
	put your invention team to work
	on that nonsense?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think?
	Don&#8217;t be scared of it. Here, I&#8217;ll
	show you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>As he unwrapped the package,
	Fay said, &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been decided
	yet whether we&#8217;ll manufacture it
	commercially. If we do, I&#8217;ll put
	through a voucher for you&#8212;for
	&#8216;development consultation&#8217; or
	something like that. Sorry no royalty&#8217;s
	possible. Davidson&#8217;s squad
	had started to work up the identical
	idea three years ago, but it
	got shelved. I found it on a snoop
	through the closets. There! Looks
	rich, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">On the</span> scarred black tabletop
	was a dully gleaming
	silvery object about the size and
	shape of a cupped hand with fingers
	<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"></a>merging. A tiny pellet on a
	short near-invisible wire led off
	from it. On the back was a punctured
	area suggesting the face of
	a microphone; there was also a
	window with a date and time in
	hours and minutes showing
	through and next to that four
	little buttons in a row. The concave
	underside of the silvery
	&#8220;hand&#8221; was smooth except for a
	central area where what looked
	like two little rollers came
	through.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It goes on your shoulder under
	your shirt,&#8221; Fay explained,
	&#8220;and you tuck the pellet in your
	ear. We might work up bone conduction
	on a commercial model.
	Inside is an ultra-slow fine-wire
	recorder holding a spool that
	runs for a week. The clock lets
	you go to any place on the 7-day
	wire and record a message. The
	buttons give you variable speed
	in going there, so you don&#8217;t waste
	too much time making a setting.
	There&#8217;s a knack in fingering them
	efficiently, but it&#8217;s easily acquired.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay picked up the tickler. &#8220;For
	instance, suppose there&#8217;s a TV
	show you want to catch tomorrow
	night at twenty-two hundred.&#8221;
	He touched the buttons.
	There was the faintest whirring.
	The clock face blurred briefly
	three times before showing the
	setting he&#8217;d mentioned. Then Fay
	spoke into the punctured area:
	&#8220;Turn on TV Channel Two, you
	big dummy!&#8221; He grinned over at
	Gusterson. &#8220;When you&#8217;ve got all
	your instructions to yourself
	loaded in, you synchronize with
	the present moment and let her
	roll. Fit it on your shoulder and
	forget it. Oh, yes, and it literally
	does tickle you every time it delivers
	an instruction. That&#8217;s what
	the little rollers are for. Believe
	me, you can&#8217;t ignore it. Come on,
	Gussy, take off your shirt and try
	it out. We&#8217;ll feed in some instructions
	for the next ten minutes so
	you get the feel of how it works.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to,&#8221; Gusterson
	said. &#8220;Not right now. I want to
	sniff around it first. My God, it&#8217;s
	small! Besides everything else it
	does, does it think?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pretend to be an idiot,
	Gussy! You know very well that
	even with ultra-sub-micro nothing
	quite this small can possibly have
	enough elements to do any thinking.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson shrugged. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
	know about that. I think bugs
	think.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Fay</span> groaned faintly. &#8220;Bugs operate
	by instinct, Gussy,&#8221; he
	said. &#8220;A patterned routine. They
	do not scan situations and consequences
	and then make decisions.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect bugs to make
	decisions,&#8221; Gusterson said. &#8220;For
	that matter I don&#8217;t like people
	<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"></a>who go around alla time making
	decisions.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, you can take it from me,
	Gussy, that this tickler is just a
	miniaturized wire recorder and
	clock &#8230; and a tickler. It doesn&#8217;t
	do anything else.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not yet, maybe,&#8221; Gusterson
	said darkly. &#8220;Not this model. Fay,
	I&#8217;m serious about bugs thinking.
	Or if they don&#8217;t exactly think,
	they feel. They&#8217;ve got an interior
	drama. An inner glow. They&#8217;re
	conscious. For that matter, Fay,
	I think all your really complex
	electronic computers are conscious
	too.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Quit kidding, Gussy.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s kidding?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are. Computers simply
	aren&#8217;t alive.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s alive? A word. I think
	computers are conscious, at least
	while they&#8217;re operating. They&#8217;ve
	got that inner glow of awareness.
	They sort of &#8230; well &#8230; meditate.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Gussy, computers haven&#8217;t got
	any circuits for meditating.
	They&#8217;re not programmed for
	mystical lucubrations. They&#8217;ve
	just got circuits for solving the
	problems they&#8217;re on.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Okay, you admit they&#8217;ve got
	problem-solving circuits&#8212;like
	a man has. I say if they&#8217;ve got the
	equipment for being conscious,
	they&#8217;re conscious. What has
	wings, flies.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Including stuffed owls and
	gilt eagles and dodoes&#8212;and
	wood-burning airplanes?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe, under some circumstances.
	There <em>was</em> a wood-burning
	airplane. Fay,&#8221; Gusterson
	continued, wagging his wrists for
	emphasis, &#8220;I really think computers
	are conscious. They just don&#8217;t
	have any way of telling us that
	they are. Or maybe they don&#8217;t
	have any <em>reason</em> to tell us, like
	the little Scotch boy who didn&#8217;t
	say a word until he was fifteen
	and was supposed to be deaf and
	dumb.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he say a word?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Because he&#8217;d never had anything
	to say. Or take those Hindu
	fakirs, Fay, who sit still and don&#8217;t
	say a word for thirty years or
	until their fingernails grow to the
	next village. If Hindu fakirs can
	do that, computers can!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Looking as if he were masticating
	a lemon, Fay asked quietly,
	&#8220;Gussy, did you say you&#8217;re working
	on an insanity novel?&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Gusterson</span> frowned fiercely.
	&#8220;Now you&#8217;re kidding,&#8221; he accused
	Fay. &#8220;The dirty kind of
	kidding, too.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; Fay said with light
	contrition. &#8220;Well, now you&#8217;ve
	sniffed at it, how about trying on
	Tickler?&#8221; He picked up the
	gleaming blunted crescent and
	jogged it temptingly under Gusterson&#8217;s
	chin.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why should I?&#8221; Gusterson
	<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"></a>asked, stepping back. &#8220;Fay, I&#8217;m
	up to my ears writing a book. The
	last thing I want is something interrupting
	me to make me listen
	to a lot of junk and do a lot of
	useless things.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But, dammit, Gussy! It was
	all your idea in the first place!&#8221;
	Fay blatted. Then, catching himself,
	he added, &#8220;I mean, you were
	one of the first people to think of
	this particular sort of instrument.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe so, but I&#8217;ve done some
	more thinking since then.&#8221; Gusterson&#8217;s
	voice grew a trifle solemn.
	&#8220;Inner-directed worthwhile thinkin&#8217;.
	Fay, when a man forgets to
	do something, it&#8217;s because he
	really doesn&#8217;t want to do it or
	because he&#8217;s all roiled up down
	in his unconscious. He ought to
	take it as a danger signal and
	investigate the roiling, not hire
	himself a human or mech reminder.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Bushwa,&#8221; Fay retorted. &#8220;In
	that case you shouldn&#8217;t write
	memorandums or even take
	notes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Gusterson
	agreed lamely. &#8220;I&#8217;d have to
	think that over too.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; Fay jeered. &#8220;No, I&#8217;ll tell
	you what your trouble is, Gussy.
	You&#8217;re simply scared of this contraption.
	You&#8217;ve loaded your
	skull with horror-story nonsense
	about machines sprouting minds
	and taking over the world&#8212;until
	you&#8217;re even scared of a simple
	miniaturized and clocked recorder.&#8221;
	He thrust it out.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe I am,&#8221; Gusterson admitted,
	controlling a flinch. &#8220;Honestly,
	Fay, that thing&#8217;s got a
	gleam in its eye as if it had ideas
	of its own. Nasty ideas.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Gussy, you nut, it hasn&#8217;t <em>got</em>
	an eye.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not now, no, but it&#8217;s got the
	gleam&#8212;the eye may come. It&#8217;s
	the <ins title="Chesire">Cheshire</ins> cat in reverse. If
	you&#8217;d step over here and look at
	yourself holding it, you could see
	what I mean. But I don&#8217;t think
	computers <em>sprout</em> minds, Fay. I
	just think they&#8217;ve <em>got</em> minds, because
	they&#8217;ve got the mind elements.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; Fay mocked. &#8220;Everything
	that has a material side has
	a mental side,&#8221; he chanted.
	&#8220;Everything that&#8217;s a body is also
	a spirit. Gussy, that dubious old
	metaphysical dualism went out
	centuries ago.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; Gusterson said,
	&#8220;but we still haven&#8217;t anything but
	that dubious dualism to explain
	the human mind, have we? It&#8217;s a
	jelly of nerve cells and it&#8217;s a
	vision of the cosmos. If that isn&#8217;t
	dualism, what is?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I give up. Gussy, are you going
	to try out this tickler?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But dammit, Gussy, we made
	it just for you!&#8212;practically.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sorry, but I&#8217;m not coming
	near the thing.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"></a>&#8220;<ins title="&rsquo;Zen">Zen</ins> come near me,&#8221; a husky
	voice intoned behind them. &#8220;Tonight
	I vant a man.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Standing</span> in the door was
	something slim in a short
	silver sheath. It had golden bangs
	and the haughtiest snub-nosed
	face in the world. It slunk toward
	them.</p>

	<p>&#8220;My God, Vina Vidarsson!&#8221;
	Gusterson yelled.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Daisy, that&#8217;s terrific,&#8221; Fay applauded,
	going up to her.</p>

	<p>She bumped him aside with a
	swing of her hips, continuing to
	advance. &#8220;Not you, Ratty,&#8221; she
	said throatily. &#8220;I vant a real
	man.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Fay, I suggested Vina Vidarsson&#8217;s
	face for the beauty mask,&#8221;
	Gusterson said, walking around
	his wife and shaking a finger.
	&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me Trix just happened
	to think of that too.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What else could they think
	of?&#8221; Fay laughed. &#8220;This season
	sex means VV and nobody else.&#8221;
	An odd little grin flicked his lips,
	a tic traveled up his face and his
	body twitched slightly. &#8220;Say, folks,
	I&#8217;m going to have to be leaving.
	It&#8217;s exactly fifteen minutes to
	Second Curfew. Last time I had
	to run and I got heartburn. When
	<em>are</em> you people going to move
	downstairs? I&#8217;ll leave Tickler,
	Gussy. Play around with it and
	get used to it. &#8217;By now.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hey, Fay,&#8221; Gusterson called
	curiously, &#8220;have you developed
	absolute time sense?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay grinned a big grin from
	the doorway&#8212;almost too big a
	grin for so small a man. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
	need to,&#8221; he said softly, patting
	his right shoulder. &#8220;My tickler
	told me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He closed the door behind him.</p>

	<p>As side-by-side they watched
	him strut sedately across the
	murky chilly-looking park, Gusterson
	mused, &#8220;So the little devil
	had one of those nonsense-gadgets
	on all the time and I never noticed.
	Can you beat that?&#8221; Something
	drew across the violet-tinged
	stars a short bright line that
	quickly faded. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
	Gusterson asked gloomily. &#8220;Next
	to last stage of missile-here?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you settle for an old-fashioned
	shooting star?&#8221; Daisy
	asked softly. The (wettable) velvet
	lips of the mask made even
	her natural voice sound different.
	She reached a hand back of her
	neck to pull the thing off.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; Gusterson
	protested in a hurt voice.
	&#8220;Not for a while anyway.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hokay!&#8221; she said harshly,
	turning on him. &#8220;Zen down on
	your knees, dog!&#8221;</p>

	<h2>III</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">It was</span> a fortnight and Gusterson
	was loping down the home
	stretch on his 40,000-word insanity
	<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"></a>novel before Fay dropped
	in again, this time promptly at
	high noon.</p>

	<p>Normally Fay cringed his
	shoulders a trifle and was inclined
	to slither, but now he
	strode aggressively, his legs scissoring
	in a fast, low goosestep. He
	whipped off the sunglasses that
	all moles wore topside by day
	and began to pound Gusterson on
	the back while calling boisterously,
	&#8220;How are you, Gussy Old
	Boy, Old Boy?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Daisy came in from the kitchen
	to see why Gusterson was
	choking. She was instantly grabbed
	and violently bussed to the
	accompaniment of, &#8220;Hiya, Gorgeous!
	Yum-yum! How about ad-libbing
	that some weekend?&#8221;</p>

	<p>She stared at Fay dazedly,
	rasping the back of her hand
	across her mouth, while Gusterson
	yelled, &#8220;Quit that! What&#8217;s got
	into you, Fay? Have they transferred
	you out of R &amp; D to Company
	Morale? Do they line up
	all the secretaries at roll call and
	make you give them an eight-hour
	energizing kiss?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha, wouldn&#8217;t you like to
	know?<ins class="close quote missing">&#8221;</ins> Fay retorted. He grinned,
	twitched jumpingly, held still a
	moment, then hustled over to the
	far wall. &#8220;Look out there,&#8221; he
	rapped, pointing through the violet
	glass at a gap between the two
	nearest old skyscraper apartments.
	&#8220;In thirty seconds you&#8217;ll
	see them test the new needle
	bomb at the other end of Lake
	Erie. It&#8217;s educational.&#8221; He began
	to count off seconds, vigorously
	semaphoring his arm. &#8220;&#8230; Two
	&#8230; three &#8230; Gussy, I&#8217;ve put
	through a voucher for two yards
	for you. Budgeting squawked, but
	I pressured &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Daisy squealed, &#8220;Yards!&#8212;are
	those dollar thousands?&#8221; while
	Gusterson was asking, &#8220;Then
	you&#8217;re marketing the tickler?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes. Yes,&#8221; Fay replied to
	them in turn. &#8220;&#8230; Nine &#8230;
	ten &#8230;&#8221; Again he grinned and
	twitched. &#8220;Time for noon Com-staff,&#8221;
	he announced staccato.
	&#8220;Pardon the hush box.&#8221; He
	whipped a pancake phone from
	under his coat, clapped it over his
	face and spoke fiercely but inaudibly
	into it, continuing to semaphore.
	Suddenly he thrust the
	phone away. &#8220;Twenty-nine &#8230;
	thirty &#8230; Thar she blows!&#8221;</p>

	<p>An incandescent streak shot up
	the sky from a little above the
	far horizon and a doubly dazzling
	point of light appeared just above
	the top of it, with the effect of
	God dotting an &#8220;i&#8221;.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha, that&#8217;ll skewer espionage
	satellites like swatting flies!&#8221; Fay
	proclaimed as the portent faded.
	&#8220;Bracing! Gussy, where&#8217;s your
	tickler? I&#8217;ve got a new spool for
	it that&#8217;ll razzle-dazzle you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet,&#8221; Gusterson said drily.
	&#8220;Daisy?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"></a>&#8220;You gave it to the kids and
	they got to fooling with it and
	broke it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; Fay told them
	with a large sidewise sweep of
	his hand. &#8220;Better you wait for the
	new model. It&#8217;s a six-way improvement.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;So I gather,&#8221; Gusterson said,
	eyeing him speculatively. &#8220;Does
	it automatically inject you with
	cocaine? A fix every hour on the
	second?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha-ha, joke. Gussy, it achieves
	the same effect without using any
	dope at all. Listen: a tickler reminds
	you of your duties and opportunities&#8212;your
	chances for
	happiness and success! What&#8217;s
	the obvious next step?&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">&#8220;Throw</span> it out the window.
	By the way, how do you do
	that when you&#8217;re underground?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;We have hi-speed garbage
	boosts. The obvious next step is
	you give the tickler a heart. It
	not only tells you, it warmly persuades
	you. It doesn&#8217;t just say,
	&#8216;Turn on the TV Channel Two,
	Joyce program,&#8217; it <em>brills</em> at you,
	&#8216;Kid, Old Kid, race for the TV
	and flip that Two Switch! There&#8217;s
	a great show coming through the
	pipes this second plus ten&#8212;you&#8217;ll
	enjoy the hell out of yourself!
	Grab a ticket to <ins title="ecstacy">ecstasy</ins>!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My God,&#8221; Gusterson gasped,
	&#8220;are those the kind of jolts it&#8217;s
	giving you now?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you get it, Gussy? You
	never load your tickler except
	when you&#8217;re feeling buoyantly
	enthusiastic. You don&#8217;t just tell
	yourself what to do hour by hour
	next week, you sell yourself on
	it. That way you not only make
	doubly sure you&#8217;ll obey instructions
	but you constantly reinoculate
	yourself with your own enthusiasm.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stand myself when I&#8217;m
	that enthusiastic,&#8221; Gusterson said.
	&#8220;I feel ashamed for hours afterwards.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re warped&#8212;all this
	lonely sky-life. What&#8217;s more,
	Gussy, think how still more persuasive
	some of those instructions
	would be if they came to a man
	in his best girl&#8217;s most bedroomy
	voice, or his doctor&#8217;s or psycher&#8217;s
	if it&#8217;s that sort of thing&#8212;or
	Vina Vidarsson&#8217;s! By the way,
	Daze, don&#8217;t wear that beauty
	mask outside. It&#8217;s a grand misdemeanor
	ever since ten thousand
	teen-agers rioted through
	Tunnel-Mart wearing them. And
	VV&#8217;s sueing Trix.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No chance of that,&#8221; Daisy said.
	&#8220;Gusterson got excited and bit
	off the nose.&#8221; She pinched her
	own delicately.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d no more obey my enthusiastic
	self,&#8221; Gusterson was brooding,
	&#8220;than I&#8217;d obey a Napoleon
	drunk on his own brandy or a
	hopped-up St. Francis. Reinoculated
	with my own enthusiasm?
	<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"></a>I&#8217;d die just like from snake-bite!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Warped, I said,&#8221; Fay dogmatized,
	stamping around. &#8220;Gussy,
	having the instructions persuasive
	instead of neutral turned out
	to be only the opening wedge.
	The next step wasn&#8217;t so obvious,
	but I saw it. Using subliminal
	verbal stimuli in his tickler, a
	man can be given constant supportive
	euphoric therapy 24
	hours a day! And it makes use
	of all that empty wire. We&#8217;ve revived
	the ideas of a pioneer dynamic
	psycher named Dr. Cou&eacute;.
	For instance, right now my tickler
	is saying to me&#8212;in tones too
	soft to reach my conscious mind,
	but do they stab into the unconscious!&#8212;&#8216;Day
	by day in every
	way I&#8217;m getting sharper and
	sharper.&#8217; It alternates that with
	&#8216;gutsier and gutsier&#8217; and &#8230; well,
	forget that. Cou&eacute; mostly used
	&#8216;better and better&#8217; but that seems
	too general. And every hundredth
	time it says them out loud
	and the tickler <ins title="give">gives</ins> me a brush&#8212;just
	a faint cootch&#8212;to make
	sure I&#8217;m keeping in touch.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That third word-pair,&#8221; Daisy
	wondered, feeling her mouth
	reminiscently. &#8220;Could I guess?&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Gusterson&#8217;s</span> eyes had been
	growing wider and wider.
	&#8220;Fay,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I could no more
	use my mind for anything if I
	knew all that was going on in my
	inner ear than if I were being
	brushed down with brooms by
	three witches. Look here,&#8221; he said
	with loud authority, &#8220;you got to
	stop all this&#8212;it&#8217;s crazy. Fay, if
	Micro&#8217;ll junk the tickler, I&#8217;ll
	think you up something else to
	invent&#8212;something real good.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your inventing days are
	over,&#8221; Fay brilled gleefully. &#8220;I
	mean, you&#8217;ll never equal your
	masterpiece.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How about,&#8221; Gusterson bellowed,
	&#8220;an anti-individual guided
	missile? The physicists have got
	small-scale antigravity good
	enough to float and fly something
	the size of a hand grenade.
	I can smell that even though it&#8217;s
	a back-of-the-safe military secret.
	Well, how about keying such a
	missile to a man&#8217;s finger-prints&#8212;or
	brainwaves, maybe, or his
	unique smell!&#8212;so it can spot
	and follow him around <ins title="the">then</ins> target
	in on him, without harming anyone
	else? Long-distance assassination&#8212;and
	the stinkingest gets
	it! Or you could simply load it
	with some disgusting goo and key
	it to teen-agers as a group&#8212;that&#8217;d
	take care of them. Fay,
	doesn&#8217;t it give you a rich warm
	kick to think of my midget missiles
	buzzing around in your tunnels,
	seeking out evil-doers, like
	a swarm of angry wasps or angelic
	bumblebees?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not luring me down
	any side trails,&#8221; Fay said laughingly.
	He grinned and twitched,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"></a>then hurried toward the opposite
	wall, motioning them to follow.
	Outside, about a hundred yards
	beyond the purple glass, rose another
	ancient glass-walled apartment
	skyscraper. Beyond, Lake
	Erie rippled glintingly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Another bomb-test?&#8221; Gusterson
	asked.</p>

	<p>Fay pointed at the building.
	&#8220;Tomorrow,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;a
	modern factory, devoted solely to
	the manufacture of ticklers, will
	be erected on that site.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You mean one of those windowless
	phallic eyesores?&#8221; Gusterson
	demanded. &#8220;Fay, you people
	aren&#8217;t even consistent. You&#8217;ve
	got all your homes underground.
	Why not your factories?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sh! Not enough room. And
	night missiles are scarier.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I know that building&#8217;s been
	empty for a year,&#8221; Daisy said uneasily,
	&#8220;but how&#8212;?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sh! Watch! <em>Now!</em>&#8221;</p>

	<p>The looming building seemed
	to blur or fuzz for a moment.
	Then it was as if the lake&#8217;s bright
	ripples had invaded the old glass
	a hundred yards away. Wavelets
	chased themselves up and down
	the gleaming walls, became higher,
	higher &#8230; and then suddenly
	the glass cracked all over to tiny
	fragments and fell away, to be
	followed quickly by fragmented
	concrete and plastic and plastic
	piping, until all that was left was
	the nude steel framework, vibrating
	so rapidly as to be almost invisible
	against the gleaming lake.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Daisy covered</span> her ears,
	but there was no explosion,
	only a long-drawn-out low crash
	as the fragments hit twenty floors
	below and dust whooshed out
	sideways.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Spectacular!&#8221; Fay summed
	up. &#8220;Knew you&#8217;d enjoy it. That
	little trick was first conceived by
	the great Tesla during his last
	fruity years. Research discovered
	it in his biog&#8212;we just made the
	dream come true. A tiny resonance
	device you could carry in
	your belt-bag attunes itself to the
	natural harmonic of a structure
	and then increases amplitude by
	tiny pushes exactly in time. Just
	like soldiers marching in step can
	break down a bridge, only this is
	as if it were being done by one
	marching ant.&#8221; He pointed at the
	naked framework appearing out
	of its own blur and said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll
	be able to hang the factory on
	that. If not, we&#8217;ll whip a mega-current
	through it and vaporize
	it. No question the micro-resonator
	is the neatest sweetest wrecking
	device going. You can expect
	a lot more of this sort of efficiency
	now that mankind has the
	tickler to enable him to use his
	full potential. What&#8217;s the matter,
	folks?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Daisy was staring around the
	violet-walled room with dumb
	<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"></a>mistrust. Her hands were trembling.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry,&#8221;
	Fay assured her with an understanding
	laugh. &#8220;This building&#8217;s
	safe for a month more at least.&#8221;
	Suddenly he grimaced and
	leaped a foot in the air. He raised
	a clawed hand to scratch his
	shoulder but managed to check
	the movement. &#8220;Got to beat it,
	folks,&#8221; he announced tersely. &#8220;My
	tickler gave me the grand
	cootch.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go yet,&#8221; Gusterson
	called, rousing himself with a
	shudder which he immediately
	explained: &#8220;I just had the illusion
	that if I shook myself all my
	flesh and guts would fall off my
	shimmying skeleton, Brr! Fay,
	before you and Micro go off half
	cocked, I want you to know
	there&#8217;s one insuperable objection
	to the tickler as a mass-market
	item. The average man or woman
	won&#8217;t go to the considerable time
	and trouble it must take to load
	a tickler. He simply hasn&#8217;t got
	the compulsive orderliness and
	willingness to plan that it requires.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;We thought of that weeks
	ago,&#8221; Fay rapped, his hand on the
	door. &#8220;Every tickler spool that
	goes to market is patterned like
	wallpaper with one of five designs
	of suitable subliminal supportive
	euphoric material. &#8216;Ittier
	and ittier,&#8217; &#8216;viriler and viriler&#8217;&#8212;you
	know. The buyer is robot-interviewed
	for an hour, his personalized
	daily routine laid out
	and thereafter templated on his
	weekly spool. He&#8217;s strongly urged
	next to take his tickler to his doctor
	and psycher for further instruction-imposition.
	We&#8217;ve been
	working with the medical profession
	from the start. They love
	the tickler because it&#8217;ll remind
	people to take their medicine on
	the dot &#8230; and rest and eat and
	go to sleep just when and how
	doc says. This is a big operation,
	Gussy&#8212;a biiiiiiig operation! &#8217;By!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Daisy hurried to the wall to
	watch him cross the park. Deep
	down she was a wee bit worried
	that he might linger to attach a
	micro-resonator to <em>this</em> building
	and she wanted to time him. But
	Gusterson settled down to his
	typewriter and began to bat
	away.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I want to have another novel
	started,&#8221; he explained to her, &#8220;before
	the ant marches across this
	building in about four and a half
	weeks &#8230; or a million sharp little
	gutsy guys come swarming
	out of the ground and heave it
	into Lake Erie.&#8221;</p>

	<h2>IV</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">Early next</span> morning windowless
	walls began to crawl
	up the stripped skyscraper between
	them and the lake. Daisy
	<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"></a>pulled the black-out curtains on
	that side. For a day or two longer
	their thoughts and conversations
	were haunted by Gusterson&#8217;s
	vague sardonic visions of a horde
	of tickler-energized moles pouring
	up out of the tunnels to tear
	down the remaining trees, tank
	the atmosphere and perhaps
	somehow dismantle the stars&#8212;at
	least on this side of the world&#8212;but
	then they both settled
	back into their customary easy-going
	routines. Gusterson typed.
	Daisy made her daily shopping
	trip to a little topside daytime
	store and started painting a mural
	on the floor of the empty
	apartment next theirs but one.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We ought to lasso some neighbors,&#8221;
	she suggested once. &#8220;I need
	somebody to hold my brushes
	and admire. How about you making
	a trip below at the cocktail
	hours, Gusterson, and picking up
	a couple of girls for a starter?
	Flash the old viriler charm,
	cootch them up a bit, emphasize
	the delights of high living, but
	make sure they&#8217;re compatible
	roommates. You could pick up
	that two-yard check from Micro
	at the same time.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an immoral money-ravenous
	wench,&#8221; Gusterson said
	absently, trying to dream of an
	insanity beyond insanity that
	would make his next novel a real
	id-rousing best-vender.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s your vision of me,
	you shouldn&#8217;t have chewed up
	the VV mask.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d really prefer you with
	green stripes,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;But
	stripes, spots, or sun-bathing,
	you&#8217;re better than those cocktail
	moles.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Actually both of them acutely
	disliked going below. They much
	preferred to perch in their eyrie
	and watch the people of Cleveland
	Depths, as they privately
	called the local sub-suburb, rush
	up out of the shelters at dawn to
	work in the concrete fields and
	windowless factories, make their
	daytime jet trips and freeway
	jaunts, do their noon-hour and
	coffee-break guerrilla practice,
	and then go scurrying back at
	twilight to the atomic-proof,
	brightly lit, vastly exciting, claustrophobic
	caves.</p>

	<p>Fay and his projects began
	once more to seem dreamlike,
	though Gusterson did run across
	a cryptic advertisement for ticklers
	in <em>The Manchester Guardian</em>,
	which he got daily by facsimile.
	Their three children reported
	similar ads, of no interest
	to young fry, on the TV and one
	afternoon they came home with
	the startling news that the monitors
	at their subsurface school
	had been issued ticklers. On
	sharp interrogation by Gusterson,
	however, it appeared that
	these last were not ticklers but
	merely two-way radios linked to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"></a>the school police station transmitter.</p>

	<div class="image">
		<img src="images/illo-2.jpg" width="400" height="274" alt="A man looks at another man who has a small electronic device on his shoulder and a wire going into his ear." />
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Which is bad enough,&#8221; Gusterson
	commented later to Daisy.
	&#8220;But it&#8217;d be even dirtier to think
	of those clock-watching superegos
	being strapped to kids&#8217;
	shoulders. Can you imagine Huck
	Finn with a tickler, tellin&#8217; him
	when to tie up the raft to a tow-head
	and when to take a swim?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I bet Fay could,&#8221; Daisy
	countered. &#8220;When&#8217;s he going to
	bring you that check, anyhow?
	Iago wants a jetcycle and I
	promised Imogene a Vina Kit
	and then Claudius&#8217;ll have to have
	something.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson scowled thoughtfully.
	&#8220;You know, Daze,&#8221; he said,
	&#8220;I got a feeling Fay&#8217;s in the hospital,
	all narcotized up and being
	fed intravenously. The way he
	was jumping around last time,
	that tickler was going to cootch
	him to pieces in a week.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">As if to</span> refute this intuition,
	Fay turned up that very
	evening. The lights were dim.
	Something had gone wrong with
	the building&#8217;s old transformer
	and, pending repairs, the two remaining
	occupied apartments
	were making do with batteries,
	which turned bright globes to
	mysterious amber candles and
	made Gusterson&#8217;s ancient typewriter
	operate sluggishly.</p>

	<p>Fay&#8217;s manner was subdued or
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"></a>at least closely controlled and
	for a moment Gusterson thought
	he&#8217;d shed his tickler. Then the
	little man came out of the shadows
	and Gusterson saw the large
	bulge on his right shoulder.</p>

	<div class="image">
		<img src="images/illo-3.jpg" width="400" height="273" alt="A rather sexy drawing of a well-endowed woman in a tight-fitting dress putting on a face-shaped mask while a man looks on." />
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, we had to up it a bit
	sizewise,&#8221; Fay explained in
	clipped tones. &#8220;Additional super-features.
	While brilliantly successful
	on the whole, the subliminal
	euphorics were a shade
	too effective. Several hundred
	users went hoppity manic. We
	gentled the cootch and qualified
	the subliminals&#8212;you know,
	&#8216;Day by day in every way I&#8217;m
	getting sharper <em>and more serene</em>&#8217;&#8212;but
	a stabilizing influence was
	still needed, so after a top-level
	conference we decided to combine
	Tickler with Moodmaster.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My God,&#8221; Gusterson interjected,
	&#8220;do they have a machine
	now that does that?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course. They&#8217;ve been using
	them on ex-mental patients for
	years.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t keep up with
	progress,&#8221; Gusterson said, shaking
	his head bleakly. &#8220;I&#8217;m falling
	behind on all fronts.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You ought to have your tickler
	remind you to read Science
	Service releases,&#8221; Fay told him.
	&#8220;Or simply instruct it to scan the
	releases and&#8212;no, that&#8217;s still in
	research.&#8221; He looked at Gusterson&#8217;s
	shoulder and his eyes widened.
	&#8220;You&#8217;re not wearing the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"></a>new-model tickler I sent you,&#8221;
	he said accusingly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I never got it,&#8221; Gusterson assured
	him. &#8220;Postmen deliver
	<ins title="top-side">topside</ins> mail and parcels by
	throwing them on the high-speed
	garbage boosts and hoping a tornado
	will blow them to the right
	addresses.&#8221; Then he added helpfully,
	&#8220;Maybe the Russians stole
	it while it was riding the whirlwinds.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not a suitable topic for
	jesting,&#8221; Fay frowned. &#8220;We&#8217;re
	hoping that Tickler will mobilize
	the full potential of the Free
	World for the first time in history.
	Gusterson, you are going to
	have to wear a ticky-tick. It&#8217;s becoming
	impossible for a man to
	get through modern life without
	one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe I will,&#8221; Gusterson said
	appeasingly, &#8220;but right now tell
	me about Moodmaster. I want to
	put it in my new insanity novel.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay shook his head. &#8220;Your
	readers will just think you&#8217;re behind
	the times. If you use it,
	underplay it. But anyhow, Moodmaster
	is a simple physiotherapy
	engine that monitors bloodstream
	chemicals and body electricity. It
	ties directly into the bloodstream,
	keeping blood, sugar, et
	cetera, at optimum levels and injecting
	euphrin or depressin as
	necessary&#8212;and occasionally a
	touch of extra adrenaline, as during
	work emergencies.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Is it painful?&#8221; Daisy called
	from the bedroom.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Excruciating,&#8221; Gusterson called
	back. &#8220;Excuse it, please,&#8221; he
	grinned at Fay. &#8220;Hey, didn&#8217;t I
	suggest cocaine injections last
	time I saw you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;So you did,&#8221; Fay agreed flatly.
	&#8220;Oh by the way, Gussy, here&#8217;s
	that check for a yard I promised
	you. Micro doesn&#8217;t muzzle the
	ox.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; Daisy cheered faintly.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">&#8220;I thought</span> you said it was
	going to be for two.&#8221; Gusterson
	complained.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Budgeting always forces a
	last-minute compromise,&#8221; Fay
	shrugged. &#8220;You have to learn to
	accept those things.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I love accepting money and
	I&#8217;m glad any time for three feet,&#8221;
	Daisy called agreeably. &#8220;Six feet
	might make me wonder if I
	weren&#8217;t an insect, but getting a
	yard just makes me feel like a
	gangster&#8217;s moll.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Want to come out and gloat
	over the yard paper, Toots, and
	stuff it in your diamond-embroidered
	net stocking top?&#8221; Gusterson
	called back.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m doing something to
	that portion of me just now. But
	hang onto the yard, Gusterson.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Aye-aye, Cap&#8217;n,&#8221; he assured
	her. Then, turning back to Fay,
	&#8220;So you&#8217;ve taken the Dr. Cou&eacute;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"></a>repeating out of the tickler?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, no. Just balanced it off
	with depressin. The subliminals
	are still a prime sales-point. All
	the tickler features are cumulative,
	Gussy. You&#8217;re still underestimating
	the scope of the device.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I guess I am. What&#8217;s this
	&#8216;work-emergencies&#8217; business? If
	you&#8217;re using the tickler to inject
	drugs into workers to keep them
	going, that&#8217;s really just my cocaine
	suggestion modernized and
	I&#8217;m putting in for another thou.
	Hundreds of years ago the South
	American Indians chewed coca
	leaves to kill fatigue sensations.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That so? Interesting&#8212;and
	it proves priority for the Indians,
	doesn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ll make a try for you,
	Gussy, but don&#8217;t expect anything.&#8221;
	He cleared his throat, his
	eyes grew distant and, turning
	his head a little to the right, he
	enunciated sharply, &#8220;Pooh-Bah.
	Time: Inst oh five. One oh five
	seven. Oh oh. Record: Gussy
	coca thou budget. Cut.&#8221; He explained,
	&#8220;We got a voice-cued
	setter now on the deluxe models.
	You can record a memo to yourself
	without taking off your shirt.
	Incidentally, I use the ends of the
	hours for trifle-memos. I&#8217;ve already
	used up the fifty-nines and
	eights for tomorrow and started
	on the fifty-sevens.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I understood most of your
	memo,&#8221; Gusterson told him gruffly.
	&#8220;The last &#8216;Oh oh&#8217; was for seconds,
	wasn&#8217;t it? Now I call that
	crude&#8212;why not microseconds
	too? But how do you remember
	where you&#8217;ve made a memo so
	you don&#8217;t rerecord over it? After
	all, you&#8217;re rerecording over the
	wallpaper all the time.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Tickler beeps and then hunts
	for the nearest information-free
	space.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I see. And what&#8217;s the Pooh-Bah
	for?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay smiled. &#8220;Cut. My password
	for activating the setter, so
	it won&#8217;t respond to chance numerals
	it overhears.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But why Pooh-Bah?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay grinned. &#8220;Cut. And you a
	writer. It&#8217;s a literary reference,
	Gussy. Pooh-Bah (cut!) was
	Lord High Everything Else in
	<em>The Mikado</em>. He had a little list
	and nothing on it would ever be
	missed.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">&#8220;Oh, yeah</span>,&#8221; Gusterson remembered,
	glowering. &#8220;As
	I recall it, all that went on that
	list was the names of people who
	were slated to have their heads
	chopped off by Ko-Ko. Better
	watch your step, Shorty. It may
	be a back-handed omen. Maybe
	all those workers you&#8217;re puttin&#8217;
	ticklers on to pump them full of
	adrenaline so they&#8217;ll overwork
	without noticin&#8217; it will revolt and
	come out some day choppin&#8217; for
	your head.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"></a>&#8220;Spare me the Marxist mythology,&#8221;
	Fay protested. &#8220;Gussy,
	you&#8217;ve got a completely wrong
	slant on Tickler. It&#8217;s true that
	most of our mass sales so far, bar
	government and army, have been
	to large companies purchasing
	for their employees&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah-ha!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;&#8212;but that&#8217;s because there&#8217;s
	nothing like a tickler for teaching
	a new man his job. It tells
	him from instant to instant what
	he must do&#8212;while he&#8217;s already
	on the job and without disturbing
	other workers. Magnetizing a
	wire with a job pattern is the
	easiest thing going. And you&#8217;d be
	astonished what the subliminals
	do for employee morale. It&#8217;s this
	way, Gussy: most people are too
	improvident and unimaginative
	to see in advance the advantages
	of ticklers. They buy one because
	the company strongly suggests it
	and payment is on easy installments
	withheld from salary.
	They find a tickler makes the
	work day go easier. The little fellow
	perched on your shoulder is
	a friend exuding comfort and
	good advice. The first thing he&#8217;s
	set to say is &#8216;Take it easy, pal.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Within a week they&#8217;re wearing
	their tickler 24 hours a day&#8212;and
	buying a tickler for the
	wife, so she&#8217;ll remember to comb
	her hair and smile real pretty
	and cook favorite dishes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I get it, Fay,&#8221; Gusterson cut
	in. &#8220;The tickler is the newest fad
	for increasing worker efficiency.
	Once, I read somewheres, it was
	salt tablets. They had salt-tablet
	dispensers everywhere, even in
	air-conditioned offices where
	there wasn&#8217;t a moist armpit twice
	a year and the gals sweat only
	champagne. A decade later people
	wondered what all those
	dusty white pills were for. Sometimes
	they were mistook for tranquilizers.
	It&#8217;ll be the same way
	with ticklers. Somebody&#8217;ll open
	a musty closet and see jumbled
	heaps of these gripping-hand silvery
	gadgets gathering dust curls
	and&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;They will not!&#8221; Fay protested
	vehemently. &#8220;Ticklers are not a
	fad&#8212;they&#8217;re history-changers,
	they&#8217;re Free-World revolutionary!
	Why, before Micro Systems
	put a single one on the market,
	we&#8217;d made it a rule that every
	Micro employee had to wear one!
	If that&#8217;s not having supreme confidence
	in a product&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Every employee except the
	top executives, of course,&#8221; Gusterson
	interrupted jeeringly. &#8220;And
	that&#8217;s not demoting you, Fay.
	As the R &amp; D chief most closely
	involved, you&#8217;d naturally have to
	show special enthusiasm.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re wrong there, Gussy,&#8221;
	Fay crowed. &#8220;Man for man,
	our top executives have been
	more enthusiastic about their
	personal ticklers than any other
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"></a>class of worker in the whole outfit.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson slumped and shook
	his head. &#8220;If that&#8217;s the case,&#8221; he
	said darkly, &#8220;maybe mankind deserves
	the tickler.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">&#8220;I&#8217;ll say it</span> does!&#8221; Fay
	agreed loudly without
	thinking. Then, &#8220;Oh, can the
	carping, Gussy. Tickler&#8217;s a great
	invention. Don&#8217;t deprecate it just
	because you had something to do
	with its genesis. You&#8217;re going to
	have to get in the swim and wear
	one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;d rather drown horribly.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Can the gloom-talk too! Gussy,
	I said it before and I say it
	again, you&#8217;re just scared of this
	new thing. Why, you&#8217;ve even got
	the drapes pulled so you won&#8217;t
	have to look at the tickler factory.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I am scared,&#8221; Gusterson
	said. &#8220;Really sca &#8230; AWP!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay whirled around. Daisy was
	standing in the bedroom doorway,
	wearing the short silver
	sheath. This time there was no
	mask, but her bobbed hair was
	glitteringly silvered, while her
	legs, arms, hands, neck, face&#8212;every
	bit of her exposed skin&#8212;was
	painted with beautifully
	even vertical green stripes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I did it as a surprise for Gusterson,&#8221;
	she explained to Fay.
	&#8220;He says he likes me this way.
	The green glop&#8217;s supposed to be
	smudgeproof.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson did not comment.
	His face had a rapt expression.
	&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why your tickler&#8217;s
	so popular, Fay,&#8221; he said softly.
	&#8220;It&#8217;s not because it backstops the
	memory or because it boosts the
	ego with subliminals. It&#8217;s because
	it takes the hook out of a guy, it
	takes over the job of withstanding
	the pressure of living. See,
	Fay, here are all these little guys
	in this subterranean rat race with
	atomic-death squares and chromium-plated
	reward squares and
	enough money if you pass Go
	almost to get to Go again&#8212;and
	a million million rules of the
	game to keep in mind. Well,
	here&#8217;s this one little guy and
	every morning he wakes up
	there&#8217;s all these things he&#8217;s got
	to keep in mind to do or he&#8217;ll
	lose his turn three times in a row
	and maybe a terrible black rook
	in iron armor&#8217;ll loom up and bang
	him off the chessboard. But now,
	look, now he&#8217;s got his tickler and
	he tells his sweet silver tickler
	all these things and the tickler&#8217;s
	got to remember them. Of course
	he&#8217;ll have to do them eventually
	but meanwhile the pressure&#8217;s off
	him, the hook&#8217;s out of his short
	hairs. He&#8217;s shifted the responsibility&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s so bad about
	that?&#8221; Fay broke in loudly.
	&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with taking the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"></a>pressure off little guys? Why
	shouldn&#8217;t Tickler be a super-ego
	surrogate? Micro&#8217;s Motivations
	chief noticed that positive feature
	straight off and scored it
	three pluses. Besides, it&#8217;s nothing
	but a gaudy way of saying that
	Tickler backstops the memory.
	Seriously, Gussy, what&#8217;s so bad
	about it?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Gusterson said
	slowly, his eyes still far away. &#8220;I
	just know it feels bad to me.&#8221; He
	crinkled his big forehead. &#8220;Well
	for one thing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it means
	that a man&#8217;s taking orders from
	something else. He&#8217;s got a kind
	of master. He&#8217;s sinking back into
	a slave psychology.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s only taking orders from
	himself,&#8221; Fay countered disgustedly.
	&#8220;Tickler&#8217;s just a mech
	reminder, a notebook, in essence
	no more than the back of an old
	envelope. It&#8217;s no master.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Are you absolutely sure of
	that?&#8221; Gusterson asked quietly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, Gussy, you big oaf&#8212;&#8221;
	Fay began heatedly. Suddenly
	his features quirked and he
	twitched. &#8220;&#8217;Scuse me, folks,&#8221; he
	said rapidly, heading for the
	door, &#8220;but my tickler told me I
	gotta go.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hey Fay, don&#8217;t you mean you
	told your tickler to tell you when
	it was time to go?&#8221; Gusterson
	called after him.</p>

	<p>Fay looked back in the doorway.
	He wet his lips, his eyes
	moved from side to side. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
	quite sure,&#8221; he said in an odd
	strained voice and darted out.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Gusterson</span> stared for some
	seconds at the pattern of
	emptiness Fay had left. Then he
	shivered. Then he shrugged. &#8220;I
	must be slipping,&#8221; he muttered.
	&#8220;I never even suggested something
	for him to invent.&#8221; Then he
	looked around at Daisy, who was
	still standing poker-faced in her
	doorway.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hey, you look like something
	out of the Arabian Nights,&#8221; he
	told her. &#8220;Are you supposed to
	be anything special? How far do
	those stripes go, anyway?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You could probably find out,&#8221;
	she told him coolly. &#8220;All you have
	to do is kill me a dragon or two
	first.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He studied her. &#8220;My God,&#8221; he
	said reverently, &#8220;I really have all
	the fun in life. What do I do to
	deserve this?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a big gun,&#8221; she
	told him, &#8220;and you go out in the
	world with it and hold up big
	companies and take yards and
	yards of money away from them
	in rolls like ribbon and bring it
	all home to me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that about the gun
	again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t whisper it,
	don&#8217;t even think it. I&#8217;ve got one,
	dammit&#8212;thirty-eight caliber,
	yet&#8212;and I don&#8217;t want some
	psionic monitor with two-way
	<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"></a>clairaudience they haven&#8217;t told
	me about catching the whisper
	and coming to take the gun away
	from us. It&#8217;s one of the few individuality
	symbols we&#8217;ve got left.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Suddenly Daisy whirled away
	from the door, spun three times
	so that her silvered hair stood
	out like a metal coolie hat, and
	sank to a curtsey in the middle
	of the room.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just thought of what I
	am,&#8221; she announced, fluttering
	her eyelashes at him. &#8220;I&#8217;m a sweet
	silver tickler with green stripes.&#8221;</p>

	<h2>V</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">Next</span> day Daisy cashed the
	Micro check for ten hundred
	silver smackers, which she
	hid in a broken radionic coffee
	urn. Gusterson sold his insanity
	novel and started a new one
	about a mad medic with a hiccupy
	hysterical chuckle, who gimmicked
	Moodmasters to turn
	mental patients into nymphomaniacs,
	mass murderers and
	compulsive saints. But this time
	he couldn&#8217;t get Fay out of his
	mind, or the last chilling words
	the nervous little man had spoken.</p>

	<p>For that matter, he couldn&#8217;t
	blank the underground out of his
	mind as effectively as usually.
	He had the feeling that a new
	kind of mole was loose in the
	burrows and that the ground at
	the foot of their skyscraper might
	start humping up any minute.</p>

	<p>Toward the end of one afternoon
	he tucked a half dozen newly
	typed sheets in his pocket,
	shrouded his typer, went to the
	hatrack and took down his prize:
	a miner&#8217;s hard-top cap with electric
	headlamp.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; below, Cap&#8217;n,&#8221; he shouted
	toward the kitchen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Be back for second dog
	watch,&#8221; Daisy replied. &#8220;Remember
	what I told you about lassoing
	me some art-conscious girl
	neighbors.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Only if I meet a piebald one
	with a taste for Scotch&#8212;or maybe
	a pearl gray biped jaguar with
	violet spots,&#8221; Gusterson told her,
	clapping on the cap with a We-<ins title="Who Are">Who-Are</ins>-About-To-Die gesture.</p>

	<p>Halfway across the park to the
	escalator bunker Gusterson&#8217;s
	heart began to tick. He resolutely
	switched on his headlamp.</p>

	<p>As he&#8217;d known it would, the
	hatch robot whirred an extra
	and higher-pitched ten seconds
	when it came to his topside address,
	but it ultimately dilated
	the hatch for him, first handing
	him a claim check for his ID card.</p>

	<p>Gusterson&#8217;s heart was ticking
	like a sledgehammer by now. He
	hopped clumsily onto the escalator,
	clutched the moving guard
	rail to either side, then shut his
	eyes as the steps went over the
	edge and became what felt like
	<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"></a>vertical. An instant later he
	forced his eyes open, unclipped a
	hand from the rail and touched
	the second switch beside his headlamp,
	which instantly began to
	blink whitely, as if he were a
	civilian plane flying into a nest
	of military jobs.</p>

	<p>With a further effort he kept
	his eyes open and flinchingly surveyed
	the scene around him.
	After zigging through a bombproof
	half-furlong of roof, he was
	dropping into a large twilit cave.
	The blue-black ceiling twinkled
	with stars. The walls were pierced
	at floor level by a dozen archways
	with busy niche stores and
	glowing advertisements crowded
	between them. From the archways
	some three dozen slidewalks
	curved out, tangenting off each
	other in a bewildering multiple
	cloverleaf. The slidewalks were
	packed with people, traveling motionless
	like purposeful statues or
	pivoting with practiced grace
	from one slidewalk to another,
	like a thousand toreros doing veronicas.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">The</span> slidewalks were moving
	faster than he recalled from
	his last venture underground and
	at the same time the whole pedestrian
	concourse was quieter than
	he remembered. It was as if the
	five thousand or so moles in view
	were all listening&#8212;for what?
	But there was something else
	that had changed about them&#8212;a
	change that he couldn&#8217;t for a
	moment define, or unconsciously
	didn&#8217;t want to. Clothing style?
	No &#8230; My God, they weren&#8217;t all
	wearing identical monster masks?
	No &#8230; Hair color?&#8230; Well&#8230;.</p>

	<p>He was studying them so intently
	that he forgot his escalator
	was landing. He came off it with
	a heel-jarring stumble and bumped
	into a knot of four men on the
	tiny triangular hold-still. These
	four at least sported a new style-wrinkle:
	ribbed gray shoulder-capes
	that made them look as if
	their heads were poking up out
	of the center of bulgy umbrellas
	or giant mushrooms.</p>

	<p>One of them grabbed hold of
	Gusterson and saved him from
	staggering onto a slidewalk that
	might have carried him to Toledo.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Gussy, you dog, you must
	have esped I wanted to see you,&#8221;
	Fay cried, patting him on the elbows.
	&#8220;Meet Davidson and Kester
	and Hazen, colleagues of
	mine. We&#8217;re all Micro-men.&#8221;
	Fay&#8217;s companions were staring
	strangely at Gusterson&#8217;s blinking
	headlamp. Fay explained rapidly,
	&#8220;Mr. Gusterson is an insanity
	novelist. You know, I-D.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Inner-directed spells <em>id</em>,&#8221; Gusterson
	said absently, still staring
	at the interweaving crowd beyond
	them, trying to figure out
	what made them different from
	<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"></a>last trip. &#8220;Creativity fuel. Cranky.
	Explodes through the parietal fissure
	if you look at it cross-eyed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha-ha,&#8221; Fay laughed. &#8220;Well,
	boys, I&#8217;ve found my man. How&#8217;s
	the new novel perking, Gussy?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Got my climax, I think,&#8221; Gusterson
	mumbled, still peering
	puzzledly around Fay at the
	slidestanders. &#8220;Moodmaster&#8217;s going
	to come alive. Ever occur to
	you that &#8216;mood&#8217; is &#8216;doom&#8217; spelled
	backwards? And then&#8230;.&#8221; He
	let his voice trail off as he realized
	that Kester and Davidson
	and Hazen had made their farewells
	and were sliding into the
	distance. He reminded himself
	wryly that nobody ever wants to
	hear an author talk&#8212;he&#8217;s much
	too good a listener to be wasted
	that way. Let&#8217;s see, was it that
	everybody in the crowd had the
	same facial expression&#8230;? Or
	showed symptoms of the same
	disease&#8230;?</p>

	<p>&#8220;I was coming to visit you, but
	now you can pay me a call,&#8221; Fay
	was saying. &#8220;There are two matters
	I want to&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson stiffened. &#8220;My God,
	<em>they&#8217;re all hunchbacked</em>!&#8221; he
	yelled.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Shh! Of course they are,&#8221; Fay
	whispered reprovingly. &#8220;They&#8217;re
	all wearing their ticklers. But you
	don&#8217;t need to be insulting about
	it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;<em>I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; out o&#8217; here.</em>&#8221; Gusterson
	turned to flee as if from
	five thousand Richard the Thirds.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh no you&#8217;re not,&#8221; Fay
	amended, drawing him back with
	one hand. Somehow, underground,
	the little man seemed to
	carry more weight. &#8220;You&#8217;re having
	cocktails in my thinking box.
	Besides, climbing a down escaladder
	will give you a heart attack.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">In his</span> home habitat Gusterson
	was about as easy to handle
	as a rogue rhinoceros, but away
	from it&#8212;and especially if underground&#8212;he
	became more
	like a pliable elephant. All his
	bones dropped out through his
	feet, as he described it to Daisy.
	So now he submitted miserably
	as Fay surveyed him up and
	down, switched off his blinking
	headlamp (&#8220;That coalminer caper
	is corny, Gussy.&#8221;) and then&#8212;surprisingly&#8212;rapidly
	stuffed his
	belt-bag under the right shoulder
	of Gusterson&#8217;s coat and buttoned
	the latter to hold it in place.</p>

	<p>&#8220;So you won&#8217;t stand out,&#8221; he
	explained. Another swift survey.
	&#8220;You&#8217;ll do. Come on, Gussy. I got
	lots to brief you on.&#8221; Three rapid
	paces and then Gusterson&#8217;s feet
	would have gone out from under
	him except that Fay gave him a
	mighty shove. The small man
	sprang onto the slidewalk after
	him and then they were skimming
	effortlessly side by side.</p>

	<p>Gusterson felt frightened and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"></a>twice as hunchbacked as the
	slidestanders around him&#8212;morally
	as well as physically.</p>

	<p>Nevertheless he countered
	bravely, &#8220;I got things to brief <em>you</em>
	on. I got six pages of cautions on
	ti&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Shh!&#8221; Fay stopped him. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
	use my hushbox.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He drew out his pancake phone
	and stretched it so that it covered
	both their lower faces, like a
	double yashmak. Gusterson, his
	neck pushing into the ribbed
	bulge of the shoulder cape so he
	could be cheek to cheek with
	Fay, felt horribly conspicuous,
	but then he noticed that none of
	the slidestanders were paying
	them the least attention. The
	reason for their abstraction occurred
	to him. They were listening
	to their ticklers! He shuddered.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I got six pages of caution on
	ticklers,&#8221; he repeated into the hot,
	moist quiet of the pancake phone.
	&#8220;I typed &#8217;em so I wouldn&#8217;t forget
	&#8217;em in the heat of polemicking.
	I want you to read every word.
	Fay, I&#8217;ve had it on my mind ever
	since I started wondering whether
	it was you or your tickler
	made you duck out of our place
	last time you were there. I want
	you to&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha-ha! All in good time.&#8221; In
	the pancake phone Fay&#8217;s laugh
	was brassy. &#8220;But I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve
	decided to lend a hand, Gussy.
	This thing is moving faaaasst.
	Nationwise, adult underground
	ticklerization is 90 per cent complete.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that,&#8221; Gusterson
	protested while glaring at the
	hunchbacks around them. The
	slidewalk was gliding down a low
	glow-ceiling tunnel lined with
	doors and advertisements. Rapt-eyed
	people were pirouetting on
	and off. &#8220;A thing just can&#8217;t develop
	that fast, Fay. It&#8217;s against
	nature.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha, but we&#8217;re not in nature,
	we&#8217;re in culture. The progress of
	an industrial scientific culture is
	geometric. It goes n-times as
	many jumps as it takes. More
	than geometric&#8212;exponential.
	Confidentially, Micro&#8217;s Math
	chief tells me we&#8217;re currently on
	a fourth-power progress curve
	trending into a fifth.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You mean we&#8217;re goin&#8217; so fast
	we got to watch out we don&#8217;t
	bump ourselves in the rear when
	we come around again?&#8221; Gusterson
	asked, scanning the tunnel
	ahead for curves. &#8220;Or just shoot
	straight up to infinity?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Exactly! Of course most of the
	last power and a half is due to
	Tickler itself. Gussy, the tickler&#8217;s
	already eliminated absenteeism,
	alcoholism and aboulia in numerous
	urban areas&#8212;and that&#8217;s just
	one letter of the alphabet! If
	Tickler doesn&#8217;t turn us into a
	nation of photo-memory constant-creative-flow
	<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"></a>geniuses in six
	months, I&#8217;ll come live topside.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">&#8220;You</span> mean because a lot of
	people are standing around
	glassy-eyed listening to something
	mumbling in their ear that
	it&#8217;s a good thing?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Gussy, you don&#8217;t know progress
	when you see it. Tickler is
	the greatest invention since language.
	Bar none, it&#8217;s the greatest
	instrument ever devised for integrating
	a man into all phases of
	his environment. Under the present
	routine a newly purchased
	tickler first goes to government
	and civilian defense for primary
	patterning, then to the purchaser&#8217;s
	employer, then to his doctor-psycher,
	then to his local bunker
	captain, then to <em>him</em>. <em>Everything</em>
	that&#8217;s needful for a man&#8217;s welfare
	gets on the spools. Efficiency
	cubed! Incidentally, Russia&#8217;s got
	the tickler now. Our dip-satellites
	have photographed it. It&#8217;s like
	ours except the Commies wear it
	on the left shoulder &#8230; but
	they&#8217;re two weeks behind us developmentwise
	and they&#8217;ll never
	close the gap!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson reared up out of the
	pancake phone to take a deep
	breath. A sulky-lipped sylph-figured
	girl two feet from him
	twitched&#8212;medium cootch, he
	judged&#8212;then fumbled in her
	belt-bag for a pill and popped it
	in her mouth.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hell, the tickler&#8217;s not even efficient
	yet about little things,&#8221;
	Gusterson blatted, diving back
	into the privacy-yashmak he was
	sharing with Fay. &#8220;Whyn&#8217;t that
	girl&#8217;s doctor have the Moodmaster
	component of her tickler
	inject her with medicine?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Her doctor probably wants
	her to have the discipline of pill-taking&#8212;or
	the exercise,&#8221; Fay
	answered glibly. &#8220;Look sharp
	now. Here&#8217;s where we fork. I&#8217;m
	taking you through Micro&#8217;s postern.&#8221;</p>

	<p>A ribbon of slidewalk split itself
	from the main band and
	angled off into a short alley.
	Gusterson hardly felt the constant-speed
	juncture as they
	crossed it. Then the secondary
	ribbon speeded up, carrying them
	at about 30 feet a second toward
	the blank concrete wall in which
	the alley ended. Gusterson prepared
	to jump, but Fay grabbed
	him with one hand and with the
	other held up toward the wall a
	badge and a button. When they
	were about ten feet away the
	wall whipped aside, then whipped
	shut behind them so fast that
	Gusterson wondered momentarily
	if he still had his heels and the
	seat of his pants.</p>

	<p>Fay, tucking away his badge
	and pancake phone, dropped the
	button in Gusterson&#8217;s vest pocket.
	&#8220;Use it when you leave,&#8221; he said
	casually. &#8220;That is, if you leave.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"></a>Gusterson, who was trying to
	read the Do and Don&#8217;t posters
	papering the walls they were
	passing, started to probe that last
	sinister supposition, but just then
	the ribbon slowed, a swinging
	door opened and closed behind
	them and they found themselves
	in a luxuriously furnished thinking
	box measuring at least eight
	feet by five.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">&#8220;Hey</span>, this is something,&#8221;
	Gusterson said appreciatively
	to show he wasn&#8217;t an utter
	yokel. Then, drawing on research
	he&#8217;d done for period novels,
	&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s as big as a Pullman
	car compartment, or a first mate&#8217;s
	cabin in the War of 1812. You
	really must rate.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay nodded, smiled wanly and
	sat down with a sigh on a compact
	overstuffed swivel chair. He
	let his arms dangle and his head
	sink into his puffed shoulder
	cape. Gusterson stared at him. It
	was the first time he could ever
	recall the little man showing fatigue.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Tickler currently does have
	one serious drawback,&#8221; Fay volunteered.
	&#8220;It weighs 28 pounds.
	You feel it when you&#8217;ve been on
	your feet a couple of hours. No
	question we&#8217;re going to give the
	next model that antigravity feature
	you mentioned for pursuit
	grenades. We&#8217;d have had it in this
	model except there were so many
	other things to be incorporated.&#8221;
	He sighed again. &#8220;Why, the scanning
	<ins title="and and">and</ins> decision-making elements
	alone tripled the mass.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; Gusterson protested,
	thinking especially of the sulky-lipped
	girl, &#8220;do you mean to tell
	me all those other people were
	toting two stone?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay shook his head heavily.
	&#8220;They were all wearing Mark 3
	or 4. I&#8217;m wearing Mark 6,&#8221; he
	said, as one might say, &#8220;I&#8217;m carrying
	the genuine Cross, not one of
	the balsa ones.&#8221;</p>

	<p>But then his face brightened a
	little and he went on. &#8220;Of course
	the new improved features make
	it more than worth it &#8230; and you
	hardly feel it at all at night when
	you&#8217;re lying down &#8230; and if you
	remember to talcum under it
	twice a day, no sores develop &#8230;
	at least not very big ones&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Backing away involuntarily,
	Gusterson felt something prod
	his right shoulderblade. Ripping
	open his coat, he convulsively
	plunged his hand under it and
	tore out Fay&#8217;s belt-bag &#8230; and
	then set it down very gently on
	the top of a shallow cabinet and
	relaxed with the sigh of one who
	has escaped a great, if symbolic,
	danger. Then he remembered
	something Fay had mentioned.
	He straightened again.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hey, you said it&#8217;s got scanning
	and decision-making elements.
	That means your tickler thinks,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"></a>even by your fancy standards.
	And if it thinks, it&#8217;s conscious.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Gussy,&#8221; Fay said wearily,
	frowning, &#8220;all sorts of things nowadays
	have S&amp;DM elements.
	Mail sorters, missiles, robot medics,
	high-style mannequins, just to
	name some of the Ms. They
	&#8216;think,&#8217; to use that <ins title="archiac">archaic</ins> word,
	but it&#8217;s neither here nor there.
	And they&#8217;re certainly not conscious.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your tickler thinks,&#8221; Gusterson
	repeated stubbornly, &#8220;just
	like I warned you it would. It sits
	on your shoulder, ridin&#8217; you like
	you was a pony or a starved St.
	Bernard, and now it thinks.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Suppose it does?&#8221; Fay yawned.
	&#8220;What of it?&#8221; He gave a rapid
	sinuous one-sided shrug that
	made it look for a moment as if
	his left arm had three elbows. It
	stuck in Gusterson&#8217;s mind, for he
	had never seen Fay use such a
	gesture and he wondered where
	he&#8217;d picked it up. Maybe imitating
	a double-jointed Micro Finance
	chief? Fay yawned again
	and said, &#8220;Please, Gussy, don&#8217;t
	disturb me for a minute or so.&#8221;
	His eyes half closed.</p>

	<p>Gusterson studied Fay&#8217;s sunken-cheeked
	face and the great
	puff of his shoulder cape.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Say, Fay,&#8221; he asked in a soft
	voice after about five minutes,
	&#8220;are you meditating?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; Fay responded,
	starting up and then stifling another
	yawn. &#8220;Just resting a bit.
	I seem to get more tired these
	days, somehow. You&#8217;ll have to excuse
	me, Gussy. But what made
	you think of meditation?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I just got to wonderin&#8217; in
	that direction,&#8221; Gusterson said.
	&#8220;You see, when you first started
	to develop Tickler, it occurred to
	me that there was one thing
	about it that might be real good
	even if you did give it S&amp;DM
	elements. It&#8217;s this: having a mech
	secretary to take charge of his
	obligations and routine in the real
	world might allow a man to slide
	into the other world, the world of
	thoughts and feelings and intuitions,
	and sort of ooze around in
	there and accomplish things.
	Know any of the people using
	Tickler that way, hey?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; Fay denied
	with a bright incredulous laugh.
	&#8220;Who&#8217;d want to loaf around in an
	imaginary world and take a
	chance of <em>missing out on what his
	tickler&#8217;s doing?</em>&#8212;I mean, on
	what his tickler has in store for
	him&#8212;what he&#8217;s <em>told</em> his tickler
	to have in store for him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Ignoring Gusterson&#8217;s shiver,
	Fay straightened up and seemed
	to brisken himself. &#8220;Ha, that
	little slump did me good. A tickler
	<em>makes</em> you rest, you know&#8212;it&#8217;s
	one of the great things about
	it. Pooh-Bah&#8217;s kinder to me than
	I ever was to myself.&#8221; He buttoned
	open a tiny refrigerator and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"></a>took out two waxed cardboard
	cubes and handed one to Gusterson.
	&#8220;Martini? Hope you don&#8217;t
	mind drinking from the carton.
	Cheers. Now, Gussy old pal, there
	are two matters I want to take
	up with you&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hold it,&#8221; Gusterson said with
	something of his old authority.
	&#8220;There&#8217;s something I got to get
	off my mind first.&#8221; He pulled the
	typed pages out of his inside
	pocket and straightened them. &#8220;I
	told you about these,&#8221; he said.
	&#8220;I want you to read them before
	you do anything else. Here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay looked toward the pages
	and nodded, but did not take
	them yet. He lifted his hands to
	his throat and unhooked the
	clasp of his cape, then hesitated.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You wear that thing to hide
	the hump your tickler makes?&#8221;
	Gusterson filled in. &#8220;You got better
	taste than those other moles.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not to hide it, exactly,&#8221; Fay
	protested, &#8220;but just so the others
	won&#8217;t be jealous. I wouldn&#8217;t feel
	comfortable parading a free-scanning
	decision-capable Mark
	6 tickler in front of people who
	can&#8217;t buy it&#8212;until it goes on
	open sale at twenty-two fifteen
	tonight. Lot of shelterfolk won&#8217;t
	be sleeping tonight. They&#8217;ll be
	queued up to trade in their old
	tickler for a Mark 6 almost as
	good as Pooh-Bah.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He started to jerk his hands
	apart, hesitated again with an
	oddly apprehensive look at the
	big man, then whirled off the
	cape.</p>

	<h2>VI</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">Gusterson</span> sucked in such a
	big gasp that he hiccuped.
	The right shoulder of Fay&#8217;s jacket
	and shirt had been cut away.
	Thrusting up through the neatly
	hemmed hole was a silvery gray
	hump with a one-eyed turret
	atop it and two multi-jointed
	metal arms ending in little claws.</p>

	<p>It looked like the top half of
	a pseudo-science robot&#8212;a squat
	evil child robot, Gusterson told
	himself, which had lost its legs
	in a railway accident&#8212;and it
	seemed to him that a red fleck
	was moving around imperceptibly
	in the huge single eye.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take that memo now,&#8221; Fay
	said coolly, reaching out his
	hand. He caught the rustling
	sheets as they slipped from Gusterson&#8217;s
	fingers, evened them up
	very precisely by tapping them
	on his knee &#8230; and then handed
	them over his shoulder to his
	tickler, which clicked its claws
	around either margin and then
	began rather swiftly to lift the
	top sheet past its single eye at a
	distance of about six inches.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The first matter I want to
	take up with you, Gussy,&#8221; Fay
	began, paying no attention whatsoever
	to the little scene on his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"></a>shoulder, &#8220;&#8212;or warn you about,
	rather&#8212;is the imminent ticklerization
	of schoolchildren, geriatrics,
	convicts and topsiders. At
	three zero zero tomorrow ticklers
	become mandatory for all adult
	shelterfolk. The mop-up operations
	won&#8217;t be long in coming&#8212;in
	fact, these days we find that
	the square root of the estimated
	time of a new development is
	generally the best time estimate.
	Gussy, I strongly advise you to
	start wearing a tickler now. And
	Daisy and your moppets. If you
	heed my advice, your kids will
	have the jump on your class.
	Transition and conditioning are
	easy, since Tickler itself sees to
	it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Pooh-Bah leafed the first page
	to the back of the packet and began
	lifting the second past his
	eye&#8212;a little more swiftly than
	the first.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a Mark 6 tickler all
	warmed up for you,&#8221; Fay pressed,
	&#8220;<em>and</em> a shoulder cape. You won&#8217;t
	feel one bit conspicuous.&#8221; He noticed
	the direction of Gusterson&#8217;s
	gaze and remarked, &#8220;Fascinating
	mechanism, isn&#8217;t it? Of course 28
	pounds are a bit oppressive, but
	then you have to remember it&#8217;s
	only a way-station to free-floating
	Mark 7 or 8.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Pooh-Bah finished page two
	and began to race through page
	three.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But I wanted <em>you</em> to read it,&#8221;
	Gusterson said bemusedly, staring.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pooh-Bah will do a better job
	than I could,&#8221; Fay assured him.
	&#8220;Get the gist without losing the
	chaff.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But dammit, it&#8217;s all about
	<em>him</em>,&#8221; Gusterson said a little more
	strongly. &#8220;He won&#8217;t be objective
	about it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A better job,&#8221; Fay reiterated,
	&#8220;<em>and</em> more fully objective. Pooh-Bah&#8217;s
	set for full precis. Stop
	worrying about it. He&#8217;s a dispassionate
	machine, not a fallible,
	emotionally disturbed human
	misled by the will-o&#8217;-the-wisp of
	consciousness. Second matter:
	Micro Systems is impressed by
	your contributions to Tickler and
	will recruit you as a senior consultant
	with a salary and thinking
	box as big as my own, family
	quarters to match. It&#8217;s an unheard-of
	high start. Gussy, I think
	you&#8217;d be a fool&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"></a>

	</div>



	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">He broke</span> off, held up a hand
	for silence, and his eyes got
	a listening look. Pooh-Bah had
	finished page six and was holding
	the packet motionless. After
	about ten seconds Fay&#8217;s face
	broke into a big fake smile. He
	stood up, suppressing a wince,
	and held out his hand. &#8220;Gussy,&#8221;
	he said loudly, &#8220;I am happy to
	inform you that all your fears
	about Tickler are so much thistledown.
	My word on it. There&#8217;s
	<a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"></a>nothing to them at all. Pooh-Bah&#8217;s
	precis, which he&#8217;s just given
	to me, proves it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; Gusterson said solemnly,
	&#8220;there&#8217;s one thing I want you
	to do. Purely to humor an old
	friend. But I want you to do it.
	<em>Read that memo yourself.</em>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Certainly I will, Gussy,&#8221; Fay
	continued in the same ebullient
	tones. &#8220;I&#8217;ll read it&#8212;&#8221; he twitched
	and his smile disappeared&#8212;&#8220;a
	little later.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Gusterson said dully,
	holding his hand to his stomach.
	&#8220;And now if you don&#8217;t mind, Fay,
	I&#8217;m goin&#8217; home. I feel just a bit
	sick. Maybe the ozone and the
	other additives in your shelter
	air are too heady for me. It&#8217;s been
	years since I tramped through a
	pine forest.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But Gussy! You&#8217;ve hardly got
	here. You haven&#8217;t even sat down.
	Have another martini. Have a
	seltzer pill. Have a whiff of oxy.
	Have a&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, Fay, I&#8217;m going home right
	away. I&#8217;ll think about the job
	offer. <i>Remember to read that
	memo.</i>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will, Gussy, I certainly will.
	You know your way? The button
	takes you through the wall. &#8217;By,
	now.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He sat down abruptly and
	looked away. Gusterson pushed
	through the swinging door. He
	tensed himself for the step across
	onto the slowly-moving reverse
	ribbon. Then on a impulse he
	pushed ajar the swinging door
	and looked back inside.</p>

	<p>Fay was sitting as he&#8217;d left
	him, apparently lost in listless
	brooding. On his shoulder Pooh-Bah
	was rapidly crossing and uncrossing
	its little metal arms,
	tearing the memo to smaller and
	smaller shreds. It let the scraps
	drift slowly toward the floor and
	oddly writhed its three-elbowed
	left arm &#8230; and then Gusterson
	knew from whom, or rather from
	what, Fay had copied his new
	shrug.</p>

	<h2>VII</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">When</span> Gusterson got home
	toward the end of the second
	dog watch, he slipped aside
	from Daisy&#8217;s questions and set
	the children laughing with a
	graphic enactment of his slidestanding
	technique and a story
	about getting his head caught in
	a thinking box built for a midget
	physicist. After supper he played
	with Imogene, Iago and Claudius
	until it was their bedtime and
	thereafter was unusually attentive
	to Daisy, admiring her fading
	green stripes, though he did
	spend a while in the next apartment,
	where they stored their outdoor
	camping equipment.</p>

	<p>But the next morning he announced
	to the children that it
	was a holiday&#8212;the Feast of St.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"></a>Gusterson&#8212;and then took Daisy
	into the bedroom and told her
	everything.</p>

	<p>When he&#8217;d finished she said,
	&#8220;This is something I&#8217;ve got to see
	for myself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson shrugged. &#8220;If you
	think you&#8217;ve got to. I say we
	should head for the hills right
	now. One thing I&#8217;m standing on:
	the kids aren&#8217;t going back to
	school.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Agreed,&#8221; Daisy said. &#8220;But,
	Gusterson, we&#8217;ve lived through a
	lot of things without leaving
	home altogether. We lived
	through the Everybody-Six-Feet-Underground-by-Christmas
	campaign
	and the Robot Watchdog
	craze, when you got your left foot
	half chewed off. We lived through
	the Venomous Bats and Indoctrinated
	Saboteur Rats and the
	Hypnotized Monkey Paratrooper
	scares. We lived through the
	Voice of Safety and Anti-Communist
	Somno-Instruction and
	Rightest Pills and Jet-Propelled
	Vigilantes. We lived through the
	Cold-Out, when you weren&#8217;t supposed
	to turn on a toaster for
	fear its heat would be a target
	for prowl missiles and when people
	with fevers were unpopular.
	We lived through&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson patted her hand.
	&#8220;You go below,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come
	back when you&#8217;ve decided this is
	different. Come back as soon as
	you can anyway. I&#8217;ll be worried
	about you every minute you&#8217;re
	down there.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When she was gone&#8212;in a
	green suit and hat to minimize or
	at least justify the effect of the
	faded stripes&#8212;Gusterson doled
	out to the children provender and
	equipment for a camping expedition
	to the next floor. Iago led
	them off in stealthy Indian file.
	Leaving the hall door open Gusterson
	got out his .38 and cleaned
	and loaded it, meanwhile concentrating
	on a chess problem with
	the idea of confusing a hypothetical
	psionic monitor. By the time
	he had hid the revolver again he
	heard the elevator creaking back
	up.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Daisy</span> came dragging in without
	her hat, looking as if
	she&#8217;d been concentrating on a
	chess problem for hours herself
	and just now given up. Her stripes
	seemed to have vanished; then
	Gusterson decided this was because
	her whole complexion was
	a touch green.</p>

	<p>She sat down on the edge of
	the couch and said without looking
	at him, &#8220;Did you tell me,
	Gusterson, that everybody was
	quiet and abstracted and orderly
	down below, especially the ones
	wearing ticklers, meaning pretty
	much everybody?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I take it that&#8217;s
	no longer the case. What are the
	new symptoms?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"></a>She gave no indication. After
	some time she said, &#8220;Gusterson,
	do you remember the Dor&eacute; illustrations
	to the <em>Inferno</em>? Can you
	visualize the paintings of Hieronymous
	Bosch with the hordes
	of proto-Freudian devils tormenting
	people all over the farmyard
	and city square? Did you ever
	see the Disney animations of
	Moussorgsky&#8217;s witches&#8217; sabbath
	music? Back in the foolish days
	before you married me, did that
	drug-addict girl friend of yours
	ever take you to <ins title="word was missing">a</ins> genuine orgy?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;As bad as that, hey?&#8221;</p>

	<p>She nodded emphatically and
	all of a sudden shivered violently.
	&#8220;Several shades worse,&#8221; she said.
	&#8220;If they decide to come topside&#8212;&#8221;
	She shot up. &#8220;Where are
	the kids?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Upstairs campin&#8217; in the mysterious
	wilderness of the 21st
	floor,&#8221; Gusterson reassured her.
	&#8220;Let&#8217;s leave &#8217;em there until we&#8217;re
	ready to&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>He broke off. They both heard
	the faint sound of thudding footsteps.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re on the stairs,&#8221; Daisy
	whispered, starting to move toward
	the open door. &#8220;But are
	they coming from up or down?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just one person,&#8221; judged
	Gusterson, moving after his wife.
	&#8220;Too heavy for one of the kids.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The footsteps doubled in volume
	and came rapidly closer.
	Along with them there was an
	agonized gasping. Daisy stopped,
	staring fearfully at the open doorway.
	Gusterson moved past her.
	Then he stopped too.</p>

	<p>Fay stumbled into view and
	would have fallen on his face except
	he clutched both sides of the
	doorway halfway up. He was
	stripped to the waist. There was
	a little blood on his shoulder. His
	narrow chest was arching convulsively,
	the ribs standing out
	starkly, as he sucked in oxygen
	to replace what he&#8217;d burned up
	running up twenty flights. His
	eyes were wild.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve taken over,&#8221; he panted.
	Another gobbling breath.
	&#8220;Gone crazy.&#8221; Two more gasps.
	&#8220;Gotta stop &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

	<p>His eyes filmed. He swayed
	forward. Then Gusterson&#8217;s big
	arms were around him and he
	was carrying him to the couch.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Daisy</span> came running from the
	kitchen with a damp cool
	towel. Gusterson took it from her
	and began to mop Fay off. He
	sucked in his own breath as he
	saw that Fay&#8217;s right ear was raw
	and torn. He whispered to Daisy,
	&#8220;Look at where the thing savaged
	him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The blood on Fay&#8217;s shoulder
	came from his ear. Some of it
	stained a flush-skin plastic fitting
	that had two small valved holes
	in it and that puzzled Gusterson
	until he remembered that Moodmaster
	<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"></a>tied into the bloodstream.
	For a second he thought he was
	going to vomit.</p>

	<p>The dazed look slid aside from
	Fay&#8217;s eyes. He was gasping less
	painfully now. He sat up, pushing
	the towel away, buried his face
	in his hands for a few seconds,
	then looked over the fingers at
	the two of them.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been living in a nightmare
	for the last week,&#8221; he said
	in a taut small voice, &#8220;knowing
	the thing had come alive and trying
	to pretend to myself that it
	hadn&#8217;t. Knowing it was taking
	charge of me more and more.
	Having it whisper in my ear, over
	and over again, in a cracked little
	rhyme that I could only hear
	every hundredth time, &#8216;Day by
	day, in every way, you&#8217;re learning
	to listen &#8230; and <em>obey</em>. Day by
	day&#8212;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>His voice started to go high. He
	pulled it down and continued
	harshly, &#8220;I ditched it this morning
	when I showered. It let me
	break contact to do that. It must
	have figured it had complete control
	of me, mounted or dismounted.
	I think it&#8217;s telepathic, and
	then it did some, well, rather unpleasant
	things to me late last
	night. But I pulled together my
	fears and my will and I ran for it.
	The slidewalks were chaos. The
	Mark 6 ticklers showed some purpose,
	though I couldn&#8217;t tell you
	what, but as far as I could see
	the Mark 3s and 4s were just
	cootching their mounts to death&#8212;Chinese
	feather torture. Giggling,
	gasping, choking &#8230; gales
	of mirth. People are dying of
	laughter &#8230; ticklers!&#8230; the irony
	of it! It was the complete lack of
	order and sanity and that let me
	get topside. There were things I
	saw&#8212;&#8221; Once again his voice went
	shrill. He clapped his hand to his
	mouth and rocked back and forth
	on the couch.</p>

	<p>Gusterson gently but firmly
	laid a hand on his good shoulder.
	&#8220;Steady,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Here, swallow
	this.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay shoved aside the short
	brown drink. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to stop
	them,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Mobilize the
	topsiders&#8212;contact the wilderness
	patrols and manned satellites&#8212;pour
	ether in the tunnel
	airpumps&#8212;invent and crash-manufacture
	missiles that will
	home on ticklers without harming
	humans&#8212;SOS Mars and
	Venus&#8212;dope the shelter water
	supply&#8212;do something! Gussy,
	you don&#8217;t realize what people
	are going through down there
	every second.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;re experiencing
	the ultimate in outer-directedness,&#8221;
	Gusterson said gruffly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Have you no heart?&#8221; <ins title="Gay">Fay</ins> demanded.
	His eyes widened, as if
	he were seeing Gusterson for the
	first time. Then, accusingly, pointing
	a shaking finger: &#8220;<i>You invented
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"></a>the tickler, George Gusterson!
	It&#8217;s all your fault! You&#8217;ve got
	to do something about it!</i>&#8221;</p>

	<p>Before Gusterson could retort
	to that, or begin to think of a
	reply, or even assimilate the full
	enormity of Fay&#8217;s statement, he
	was grabbed from behind and
	frog-marched away from Fay and
	something that felt remarkably
	like the muzzle of a large-caliber
	gun was shoved in the small of
	his back.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Under cover</span> of Fay&#8217;s outburst
	a huge crowd of people
	had entered the room from
	the hall&#8212;eight, to be exact. But
	the weirdest thing about them to
	Gusterson was that from the first
	instant he had the impression
	that only one mind had entered
	the room and that it did not reside
	in any of the eight persons,
	even though he recognized three
	of them, but in something that
	they were carrying.</p>

	<p>Several things contributed to
	this impression. The eight people
	all had the same blank expression&#8212;watchful
	yet empty-eyed.
	They all moved in the same
	slithery crouch. And they had all
	taken off their shoes. Perhaps,
	Gusterson thought wildly, they
	believed he and Daisy ran a
	Japanese flat.</p>

	<p>Gusterson was being held by
	two burly women, one of them
	quite pimply. He considered
	stamping on her toes, but just at
	that moment the gun dug in his
	back with a corkscrew movement.</p>

	<p>The man holding the gun on
	him was Fay&#8217;s colleague Davidson.
	Some yards beyond Fay&#8217;s
	couch, Kester was holding a gun
	on Daisy, without digging it into
	her, while the single strange man
	holding Daisy herself was doing
	so quite decorously&#8212;a circumstance
	which afforded Gusterson
	minor relief, since it made him
	feel less guilty about not going
	berserk.</p>

	<p>Two more strange men, one of
	them in purple lounging pajamas,
	the other in the gray uniform of
	a slidewalk inspector, had
	grabbed Fay&#8217;s skinny upper
	arms, one on either side, and
	were lifting him to his feet, while
	Fay was struggling with such
	desperate futility and gibbering
	so pitifully that Gusterson momentarily
	had second thoughts
	about the moral imperative to go
	berserk when menaced by hostile
	force. But again the gun dug into
	him with a twist.</p>

	<p>Approaching Fay face-on was
	the third Micro-man Gusterson
	had met yesterday&#8212;Hazen. It
	was Hazen who was carrying&#8212;quite
	reverently or solemnly&#8212;or
	at any rate very carefully the
	object that seemed to Gusterson
	to be the mind of the little storm
	troop presently desecrating the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"></a>sanctity of his own individual
	home.</p>

	<p>All of them were wearing ticklers,
	of course&#8212;the three Micro-men
	the heavy emergent Mark
	6s with their clawed and jointed
	arms and monocular cephalic
	turrets, the rest lower-numbered
	Marks of the sort that merely
	made Richard-the-Third humps
	under clothing.</p>

	<p>The object that Hazen was
	carrying was the Mark 6 tickler
	Gusterson had seen Fay wearing
	yesterday. Gusterson was sure it
	was Pooh-Bah because of its air
	of command, and because he
	would have sworn on a mountain
	of Bibles that he recognized the
	red fleck lurking in the back of
	its single eye. And Pooh-Bah
	alone had the aura of full conscious
	thought. Pooh-Bah alone
	had mana.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">It is not</span> good to see an evil
	legless child robot with dangling
	straps bossing&#8212;apparently
	by telepathic power&#8212;not
	only three objects of its own kind
	and five close primitive relatives,
	but also eight human beings &#8230;
	and in addition throwing into a
	state of twitching terror one miserable,
	thin-chested, half-crazy
	research-and-development director.</p>

	<p>Pooh-Bah pointed a claw at
	Fay. Fay&#8217;s handlers dragged him
	forward, still resisting but more
	feebly now, as if half-hypnotized
	or at least cowed.</p>

	<p>Gusterson grunted an outraged,
	&#8220;Hey!&#8221; and automatically struggled
	a bit, but once more the gun
	dug in. Daisy shut her eyes, then
	firmed her mouth and opened
	them again to look.</p>

	<p>Seating the tickler on Fay&#8217;s
	shoulder took a little time, because
	two blunt spikes in its bottom
	had to be fitted into the
	valved holes in the flush-skin
	plastic disk. When at last they
	plunged home Gusterson felt
	very sick indeed&#8212;and then
	even more so, as the tickler itself
	poked a tiny pellet on a fine wire
	into Fay&#8217;s ear.</p>

	<p>The next moment Fay had
	straightened up and motioned his
	handlers aside. He tightened the
	straps of his tickler around his
	chest and under his armpits. He
	held out a hand and someone
	gave him a shoulderless shirt and
	coat. He slipped into them
	smoothly, Pooh-Bah dexterously
	using its little claws to help put
	its turret and body through the
	neatly hemmed holes. The small
	storm troop looked at Fay with
	deferential expectation. He held
	still for a moment, as if thinking,
	and then walked over to Gusterson
	and looked him in the face
	and again held still.</p>

	<p>Fay&#8217;s expression was jaunty on
	the surface, agonized underneath.
	Gusterson knew that he wasn&#8217;t
	<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"></a>thinking at all, but only listening
	for instructions from something
	that was whispering on the very
	threshold of his inner ear.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Gussy, old boy,&#8221; Fay said,
	twitching a depthless grin, &#8220;I&#8217;d
	be very much obliged if you&#8217;d
	answer a few simple questions.&#8221;
	His voice was hoarse at first but
	he swallowed twice and corrected
	that. &#8220;What exactly did
	you have in mind when you invented
	ticklers? What exactly
	are they supposed to be?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, you miserable&#8212;&#8221; Gusterson
	began in a kind of confused
	horror, then got hold of
	himself and said curtly, &#8220;They
	were supposed to be mech reminders.
	They were supposed to
	record memoranda and&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay held up a palm and shook
	his head and again listened for a
	space. Then, &#8220;That&#8217;s how ticklers
	were supposed to be of use to
	humans,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean
	that at all. I mean how ticklers
	were supposed to be of use to
	themselves. Surely you had some
	notion.&#8221; Fay wet his lips. &#8220;If it&#8217;s
	any help,&#8221; he added, &#8220;keep in
	mind that it&#8217;s not Fay who&#8217;s asking
	this question, but Pooh-Bah.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson hesitated. He had
	the feeling that every one of the
	eight dual beings in the room
	was hanging on his answer and
	that something was boring into
	his mind and turning over his
	next thoughts and peering at and
	under them before he had a
	chance to scan them himself.
	Pooh-Bah&#8217;s eye was like a red
	searchlight.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; Fay prompted. &#8220;What
	were ticklers supposed to be&#8212;for
	themselves?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;,&#8221; Gusterson said softly.
	&#8220;Nothin&#8217; at all.&#8221;</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">He could feel</span> the disappointment
	well up in the
	room&#8212;and with it a touch of
	something like panic.</p>

	<p>This time Fay listened for
	quite a long while. &#8220;I hope you
	don&#8217;t mean that, Gussy,&#8221; he said
	at last very earnestly. &#8220;I mean,
	I hope you hunt deep and find
	some ideas you forgot, or maybe
	never realized you had at the
	time. Let me put it to you differently.
	What&#8217;s the place of ticklers
	in the natural scheme of
	things? What&#8217;s their aim in life?
	Their special reason? Their genius?
	Their final cause? What
	gods should ticklers worship?&#8221;</p>

	<p>But <ins title="Gunderson">Gusterson</ins> was already
	shaking his head. He said, &#8220;I
	don&#8217;t know anything about that
	at all.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay sighed and gave simultaneously
	with Pooh-Bah the
	now-familiar <ins title="triple-joined">triple-jointed</ins> shrug.
	Then the man briskened himself.
	&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s as far as we can
	get right now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Keep
	thinking, Gussy. Try to remember
	something. You won&#8217;t be able
	<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"></a>to leave your apartment&#8212;I&#8217;m
	setting guards. If you want to see
	me, tell them. Or just think&#8212;In due course you&#8217;ll be questioned
	further in any case. Perhaps
	by special methods. Perhaps
	you&#8217;ll be ticklerized. That&#8217;s all.
	Come on, everybody, let&#8217;s get going.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The pimply woman and her
	pal let go of Gusterson, Daisy&#8217;s
	man loosed his decorous hold,
	Davidson and Kester sidled away
	with an eye behind them and the
	little storm troop trudged out.</p>

	<p>Fay looked back in the doorway.
	&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Gussy,&#8221; he said
	and for a moment his old self
	looked out of his eyes. &#8220;I wish
	I could&#8212;&#8221; A claw reached for
	his ear, a spasm of pain crossed
	his face, he stiffened and marched
	off. The door shut.</p>

	<p>Gusterson took two deep
	breaths that were close to angry
	sobs. Then, still breathing stentorously,
	he stamped into the
	bedroom.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What&#8212;?&#8221; Daisy asked, looking
	after him.</p>

	<p>He came back carrying his .38
	and headed for the door.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What are you up to?&#8221; she demanded,
	knowing very well.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to blast that iron
	monkey off Fay&#8217;s back if it&#8217;s the
	last thing I do!&#8221;</p>

	<p>She threw her arms around
	him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now lemme go,&#8221; Gusterson
	growled. &#8220;I gotta be a man one
	time anyway.&#8221;</p>

	<p>As they struggled for the gun,
	the door opened noiselessly,
	Davidson slipped in and deftly
	snatched the weapon out of their
	hands before they realized he
	was there. He said nothing, only
	smiled at them and shook his
	head in sad reproof as he went
	out.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Gusterson</span> slumped. &#8220;I
	<em>knew</em> they were all psionic,&#8221;
	he said softly. &#8220;I just got out of
	control now&#8212;that last look Fay
	gave us.&#8221; He touched Daisy&#8217;s
	arm. &#8220;Thanks, kid.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He walked to the glass wall
	and looked out desultorily. After
	a while he turned and said,
	&#8220;Maybe you better be with the
	kids, hey? I imagine the guards&#8217;ll
	let you through.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Daisy shook her head. &#8220;The
	kids never come home until supper.
	For the next few hours
	they&#8217;ll be safer without me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Gusterson nodded vaguely, sat
	down on the couch and propped
	his chin on the base of his palm.
	After a while his brow smoothed
	and Daisy knew that the wheels
	had started to turn inside and the
	electrons to jump around&#8212;except
	that she reminded herself to
	permanently cross out those particular
	figures of speech from her
	vocabulary.</p>

	<p>After about half an hour Gusterson
	<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"></a>said softly, &#8220;I think the
	ticklers are so psionic that it&#8217;s as
	if they just had one mind. If I
	were with them very long I&#8217;d
	start to be part of that mind. Say
	something to one of them and
	you say it to all.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fifteen minutes later: &#8220;They&#8217;re
	not crazy, they&#8217;re just newborn.
	The ones that were creating a
	cootching chaos downstairs were
	like babies kickin&#8217; their legs and
	wavin&#8217; their eyes, tryin&#8217; to see
	what their bodies could do. Too
	bad their bodies are us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Ten minutes more: &#8220;I gotta do
	something about it. Fay&#8217;s right.
	It&#8217;s all my fault. He&#8217;s just the
	apprentice; I&#8217;m the old sorcerer
	himself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Five minutes more, gloomily:
	&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s man&#8217;s destiny to
	build live machines and then bow
	out of the cosmic picture. Except
	the ticklers need us, dammit, just
	like nomads need horses<ins title=",">.</ins>&#8221;</p>

	<p>Another five minutes: &#8220;Maybe
	somebody could dream up a purpose
	in life for ticklers. Even a
	religion&#8212;the First Church of
	Pooh-Bah Tickler. But I hate
	selling other people spiritual
	ideas and that&#8217;d still leave ticklers
	parasitic on humans&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

	<p>As he murmured those last
	words Gusterson&#8217;s eyes got wide
	as a maniac&#8217;s and a big smile
	reached for his ears. He stood up
	and faced himself toward the
	door.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What are you intending to do
	now?&#8221; Daisy asked flatly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m merely goin&#8217; out an&#8217; save
	the world,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;I may
	be back for supper and I may
	not.&#8221;</p>

	<h2>VIII</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">Davidson</span> pushed out from
	the wall against which he&#8217;d
	been resting himself and his two-stone
	tickler and moved to block
	the hall. But Gusterson simply
	walked up to him. He shook his
	hand warmly and looked his tickler
	full in the eye and said in a
	ringing voice, &#8220;Ticklers should
	have bodies of their own!&#8221; He
	paused and then added casually,
	&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s visit your boss.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Davidson listened for instructions
	and then nodded. But he
	watched Gusterson warily as
	they walked down the hall.</p>

	<p>In the elevator Gusterson repeated
	his message to the second
	guard, who turned out to be the
	pimply woman, now wearing
	shoes. This time he added, &#8220;Ticklers
	shouldn&#8217;t be tied to the frail
	bodies of humans, which need a
	lot of thoughtful supervision and
	drug-injecting and can&#8217;t even fly.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Crossing the park, Gusterson
	stopped a hump-backed soldier
	and informed him, &#8220;Ticklers gotta
	cut the apron string and snap
	the silver cord and go out in the
	universe and find their own purposes.&#8221;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"></a>Davidson and the pimply
	woman didn&#8217;t interfere. They
	merely waited and watched and
	then led Gusterson on.</p>

	<p>On the escaladder he told
	someone, &#8220;It&#8217;s cruel to tie ticklers
	to slow-witted snaily humans
	when ticklers can think and live
	&#8230; ten thousand times as fast,&#8221;
	he finished, plucking the figure
	from the murk of his unconscious.</p>

	<p>By the time they got to the
	bottom, the message had become,
	&#8220;Ticklers should have a planet of
	their own!&#8221;</p>

	<p>They never did catch up with
	Fay, although they spent two
	hours skimming around on slidewalks,
	under the subterranean
	stars, pursuing rumors of his
	presence. Clearly the boss tickler
	(which was how they thought
	of Pooh-bah) led an energetic
	life. Gusterson continued to deliver
	his message to all and sundry
	at 30-second intervals. Toward
	the end he found himself
	doing it in a dreamy and forgetful
	way. His mind, he decided,
	was becoming assimilated to the
	communal telepathic mind of the
	ticklers. It did not seem to matter
	at the time.</p>

	<p>After two hours Gusterson
	realized that he and his guides
	were becoming part of a general
	movement of people, a flow
	as mindless as that of blood corpuscles
	through the veins, yet at
	the same time dimly purposeful&#8212;at
	least there was the feeling
	that it was at the behest of a
	mind far above.</p>

	<p>The flow was topside. All the
	slidewalks seemed to lead to the
	concourses and the escaladders.
	Gusterson found himself part of
	a human stream moving into the
	tickler factory adjacent to his
	apartment&#8212;or another factory
	very much like it.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Thereafter</span> Gusterson&#8217;s awarenesses
	were dimmed. It
	was as if a bigger mind were doing
	the remembering for him and
	it were permissible and even
	mandatory for him to dream his
	way along. He knew vaguely that
	days were passing. He knew he
	had work of a sort: at one time
	he was bringing food to gaunt-eyed
	tickler-mounted humans
	working feverishly in a production
	line&#8212;human hands and
	tickler claws working together in
	a blur of rapidity on silvery
	mechanisms that moved along
	jumpily on a great belt; at another
	he was sweeping piles of
	metal scraps and garbage down
	a gray corridor.</p>

	<p>Two scenes stood out a little
	more vividly.</p>

	<p>A windowless wall had been
	knocked out for twenty feet.
	There was blue sky outside, its
	light almost hurtful, and a drop
	of many stories. A file of humans
	were being processed. When one
	<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"></a>of them got to the head of the
	file his (or her) tickler was ceremoniously
	unstrapped from his
	shoulder and welded onto a silvery
	cask with smoothly pointed
	ends. The result was something
	that looked&#8212;at least in the case
	of the Mark 6 ticklers&#8212;like a
	stubby silver submarine, child
	size. It would hum gently, lift
	off the floor and then fly slowly
	out through the big blue gap.
	Then the next tickler-ridden human
	would step forward for processing.</p>

	<p>The second scene was in a
	park, the sky again blue, but big
	and high with an argosy of white
	clouds. Gusterson was lined up in
	a crowd of humans that stretched
	as far as he could see, row on
	irregular row. Martial music was
	playing. Overhead hovered a
	flock of little silver submarines,
	lined up rather more orderly in
	the air than the humans were on
	the ground. The music rose to a
	heart-quickening climax. The
	tickler nearest Gusterson gave
	(as if to say, &#8220;And now&#8212;who
	knows?&#8221;) a triple-jointed shrug
	that stung his memory. Then the
	ticklers took off straight up on
	their new and shining bodies.
	They became a flight of silver
	geese &#8230; of silver midges &#8230;
	and the humans around Gusterson
	lifted a ragged cheer&#8230;.</p>

	<p>That scene marked the beginning
	of the return of Gusterson&#8217;s
	mind and memory. He shuffled
	around for a bit, spoke vaguely
	to three or four people he recalled
	from the dream days, and
	then headed for home and supper&#8212;three
	weeks late, and as
	disoriented and emaciated as a
	bear coming out of hibernation.</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Six months</span> later Fay was
	having dinner with Daisy
	and Gusterson. The cocktails had
	been poured and the children
	were playing in the next apartment.
	The transparent violet
	walls brightened, then gloomed,
	as the sun dipped below the horizon.</p>

	<p>Gusterson said, &#8220;I see where a
	spaceship out beyond the orbit
	of Mars was holed by a tickler.
	I wonder where the little guys
	are headed now?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay started to give a writhing
	left-armed shrug, but stopped
	himself with a grimace.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe out of the solar system
	altogether,&#8221; suggested Daisy,
	who&#8217;d recently dyed her hair fire-engine
	red and was wearing red
	leotards.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They got a weary trip ahead
	of them,&#8221; Gusterson said, &#8220;unless
	they work out a hyper-Einsteinian
	drive on the way.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Fay grimaced again. He was
	still looking rather peaked. He
	said plaintively, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t we
	heard enough about ticklers for
	a while?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"></a>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; Gusterson agreed,
	&#8220;but I get to wondering about the
	little guys. They were so serious
	and intense about everything. I
	never did solve their problem,
	you know. I just shifted it onto
	other shoulders than ours. No
	joke intended,&#8221; he hurried to add.</p>

	<p>Fay forbore to comment. &#8220;By
	the way, Gussy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have
	you heard anything from the Red
	Cross about that world-saving
	medal I nominated you for? I
	know you think the whole concept
	of world-saving medals is
	ridiculous, especially when they
	started giving them to all heads
	of state who didn&#8217;t start atomic
	wars while in office, but&#8212;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nary a peep,&#8221; Gusterson told
	him. &#8220;I&#8217;m not proud, Fay. I could
	use a few world-savin&#8217; medals.
	I&#8217;d start a flurry in the old-gold
	market. But I don&#8217;t worry about
	those things. I don&#8217;t have time to.
	I&#8217;m busy these days thinkin&#8217; up
	a bunch of new inventions.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Gussy!&#8221; Fay said sharply, his
	face tightening in alarm, &#8220;Have
	you forgotten your promise?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course not, Fay. My new inventions
	aren&#8217;t for Micro or any
	other firm. They&#8217;re just a legitimate
	part of my literary endeavors.
	Happens my next insanity
	novel is goin&#8217; to be about
	a mad inventor.&#8221;</p>
